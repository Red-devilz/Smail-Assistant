Hello all,

This is a final reminder for this survey. We have extended the deadline to
midnight, *12 October (Wednesday)*. 600 responses have been received as of
now.

The results will also be used by the SLC Committee working on forming
guidelines for CCASH, the formal body dealing with these issues, so it
would be very valuable to get all your inputs.

To reiterate: students of all genders can fill this, and you can fill it
whether or not you have faced gender based harassment. Filling it will not
take much of your time. Please do share with your friends.

Warm regards,
The T5E Team
