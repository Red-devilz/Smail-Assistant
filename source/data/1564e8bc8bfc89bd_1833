of Mitr, separating it into two functional bodies, *Saathi* and *Mitr*, the
former being a SAC-approved body, acts as proactive front and caters to all
the events related to the well being of the students. Mitr, by retaining
its status as an institute body refurnished into a reactive body, whose
objective is to provide emotional support to the students in times of thier
need. It assures to be a complete confidential and one to one basis support
system.
