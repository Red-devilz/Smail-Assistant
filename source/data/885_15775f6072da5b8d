Hello Everyone,
A workshop by Google is going to happen on Friday( 30916 ) 8 pm  10:30
pm at the CRC.

This event is aimed mostly at students in need of programming preparation
(Those appearing for placement or internship interviews shortly).

A rough overview of the event is as follows:

1. Culture at Google. The objective is to help students understand the
culture at Google (particularly about Engg teams) since many are interested
in it, and help do their exploration of the culture(s) that matters to them.

2. Tackling problems in interviews. We will walk through some of the
challenges of the type that we typically ask as part of our interviews.
It's very interactive and helps students understand some good practices.

3. Code Lab or Tech talk. If it's a code lab, we will walk through how to
approach algorithmic and data structure specific problems. If it's a tech
talk, we will share the topic early next week.

Any further details will be intimated at a later point.

Regards,
Mohnish Sai Prasad Uyyuru,
