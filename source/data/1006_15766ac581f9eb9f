 Hello all,

th
 September,2016 at Himalaya ground floor from 6pm to 9pm. All the
 coordinators are requested to collect them during this time as they will
 not be distributed again. For those who are not able to collect them on
 that day, they can ask their friends to do so, provided they produce your
 institute ID card at the PPM desk.

 Whoever has not collected their Shaastra 2015 certificates can also
 collect them during this time. Please make use of this opportunity.

 PS An ID proof is necessary for procuring your certificates.
