Sir,

Prem Krishnaa(CS14b049) and myself Rahul Ramesh(CS14b061) part of team
Daemon, are assigned to you for the OS Lab1 Viva. Is it possible to have
the Viva on Friday evening(at 4:00) or on Saturday morning(around 11:00).
We would prefer to have it on either of these days(preferably Friday) owing
to quizzes(starting on Friday 2nd Sept).
Thanks.



Rahul Ramesh
