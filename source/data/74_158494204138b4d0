Hi guys,

On 12th of November, Newslaundry Speak Out
 will be at our college to host the
auditions for its annual debate competition in New Delhi.

Organized by Newslaundry  and Facebook, Speak
Out is a debating platform that is travelling to 20 colleges across the
country for college auditions. 30 students who make through the college
auditions will be flown to Delhi for the Grand Finale at the NCIU
Auditorium in Delhi where they will fight it out for the Speak Out title.

All details about the format and debate motions can be found on the Speak
Out website, here . For regular
updates about the event, check out the Facebook page, here

The college auditions will be in the conventional debate format, where
participants will speak on a choice of their motion for 3.30 minutes. These
motions must be picked from the list of Speak Out debate motions that can
be accessed on the Speak Out website.

PS: We know it is right before the end semesters, but the auditions are
just going to be a 3 and a half minute affair, definitely worth it!
