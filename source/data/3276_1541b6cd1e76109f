Re: Gangasters Playing of Music in Ganga

Body:
@arjunar grow up please. You're being a crying baby here.

PS  you sent me a participation certificate in your school annual day. LOL.

I rest my case. And am going to ignore any more replies on this thread and
blissfully pretend you don't exist.

 +1 to Ravi. Even I never heard of such issues being raised.

 I have no connection into music but their's was pretty decent to hear.
 Their volume level was pretty reasonable and you can't ask them to play
 music like murmuring. If someone is very good at music, why can't you just
 participate in the hostel team? Or atleast guide them to play properly?
 Openly criticizing says that you have no feel for hostel at all, try
 encouraging man. You need not cheer all the way during their participation,
 atleast adjust for very few days.

 @Rakesh Vakr, All the hostels participate and hence practice. Hence
 changing hostel might not help him. Probably he should stay outside campus
 himself without any authorities involving.

 If Ganga is nothing to you more than a hostel, your certificates are
 nothing more than a paper.

 @arjunar Thanks for your opinion, but I assure you we do not give a
 rat's posterior end about it. We're pretty convinced the issue isn't with
 our music, par Kanpur mein kuch problem hai. I call bluff on your claims of
 you being a musician yourself, because a true musician wouldn't berate
 another's efforts. I maintain that you're either tonedeaf or that you are
 hallucinating the "music that sucks".
 The world does not revolve around you, and certainly, neither does Ganga
 hostel.

 This direct offensive assault on the quality of the Ganga music team is
 really depressing, as we want the hostel members to be one big united
 family (not that we are taking it one bit seriously). You really do not
 seem to fit in here. Instead of all of us going elsewhere, why don't you
 request for a change of hostel? That's a more feasible solution, and a
 winwin situation for us.

 Thanks, don't come again
