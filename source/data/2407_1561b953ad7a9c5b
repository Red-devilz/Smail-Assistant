Welcome back

Dear friends,

Welcome to a new beginning and a new academic year with freshness in the ai
r.  For most of you the break would have provided a period of connecting ba
ck with your family, reflecting and regrouping to be ready for a new beginn
ing.

I have been waiting for this long week to pass to see the familiar faces ag
ain, ever fresh and full of energy. To connect with friends again is going 
to be a delight! Hope your summer went well with catching up on several fro
nts!  The past few days have been unusually pleasant in Chennai, perhaps, a
waiting your arrival :)

Your seniors were leaving the campus with a heavy heart after the convocati
on  who will want to leave such a campus which has captured their joys and
 dreams?

BTW, CCD (I'm sorry  CCD+ now) is back! Never have I seen Biryani and idli
 available in a CCD!!!

Last academic year saw a lot of initiatives with a lot more flagship events
 such as MUN, Saahitya, ESummit, etc.  The coming year promises to scale g
reater heights!  Your sportsperson friends are already here gearing up for 
a return to the throne.

While wishing you all the best, I also want to convey to you a message that
 I feel is important and critical for your personal and professional growth
.

We know that all of us are fortunate to be at IIT Madras and there are at l
east a million young people who are envious of the position and the privile
ge that we enjoy.  The question is: Should we waste this opportunity or sho
uld we use our imagination and intelligence to create a world that everyone
 will be grateful for and be proud of?

Once again, welcome to the world of learning and fun.

Anbudan,
Siva
(your DoSt)
