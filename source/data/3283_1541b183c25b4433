Subject:
Re: Gangasters Playing of Music in Ganga

Body:
Sorry to interrupt your "Serious" discussions guys, but can't stop myself
from advising both of you peoples.

Being a final year student, this is the first time I had witnessed this
issue! , in fact a valid one. here I present you a solution:

1.Why not keep your earphones/headphones on and listen to your favorite
music(which we always do :D ) during the night time when they are playing
and try to sleep if their music really sucks. (Am I rude? maybe, but Am not
when compared to these responses here :p )

2.We just can't ask them to stop before 8pm/10pm for our own sake(we being
selfish?), as they are practicing for hostel, i.e for us! ,in return see
what they are getting.


P.S: Admire them or else ignore them but don't degrade them.

 1. Volume was not lowered on request for three days. Each day they told
 that they would reduce the volume but they didn't.
 2. I love music. In fact, I learned tabla and other percussion instrument
s
 for 10 years and had 2 state level participations, But as I mentioned
 before, your music sucks. Try practicing somewhere else or at least get t
he
 room sound proof.

 Not against practice. Never was.
 But for everything there is time, there is limit. You can't go till 1 or
 2 am.
 Follow those and practice. Keep the volume low. Thats it. We will be
 supportive to low music.

 @Punit: Hahahaha. That was good but please provide us a short term
 solution.That will be helpful F0FB

 I have a solution for this problem...
 The new gensec has already sent out a mail for new room allocation
 choices...

 How about students who support the late night music practice will move
 nearer to music room and vice versa...

 Just think about it.....

 A few things.

 i) Permission was granted to us till 10PM and not 8PM as wrongly
 stated in the initial mail. And as our exsocsecs will assure you, our
 warden is very supportive of us participating in cultural activities. 
Also,
 over the past couple of years, hostel music practice happened over two
 months, and not a few days like this time (sadly). We never had any
 complaints, since the inhabitants of Ganga understood that this is a
 hostel, and certain compromises had to be made to support mates who ar
e
 representing the spirit of Ganga. (GO GANGA!)

 ii) We too, just like everyone else have classes in the morning and
 labs till the evening (quite surprising? I think not), so practising a
t
 these times is definitely out of the question.

 iii) We too have exams, assignments, reports, submissions,
 deadlines, internship interviews and what not along with Saarang/Shaas
tra
 app deadlines. Heck, I'm losing count of the number of sleepless night
s
 I've had for the same reasons. We are taking time out of our schedules
 for
 the hostel to participate in these events, and the least we could have
 is
 some compromise from our hostel mates, instead of relentless cribs. Wh
en
 you came down and unceremoniously disrupted our sessions and asked us 
to
 reduce the volume, we did. We have been lowering volumes repeatedly
 since you guys complained.

 iv) @ArjunAR, we've had several people come down to the music room
 from their rooms or the quadi to listen to us. All of them said we sou
nd
 nice. So I'm going to make the statistically safe option of assuming y
ou
 are quite tonedeaf.

 v) These incidents are strongly reminding me of my childhood and
 those neighbourhood aunties and uncles who used to scream at my friend
s and
 I for playing football and cricket on the streets. Not so desirable
 nostalgia, to be blatantly honest.

 PS 1  If you have any cribs, please contact me at +919962615051 and
 let me know, instead of bursting in like you own the hostel.

 PS 2  Again, GO GANGA!

 Godspeed
 Vakr

 @Venkatraman
 Even if these guys believe you, why should they agree to you? What if
 they have equally important priorities for which they're working equa
lly
 hard, and don't give a shit about hostel litsoc glory? :P

 Hi!

 I am staying in Room Number 163, which is right outside the place
 where they are practicing. I know that at times, the sound is annoyi
ng  I
 have felt the same way at times too. But I think its also our
 responsibility to do everything we can to facilitate students who ar
e
 representing our hostel in LitSoc. I know the junta who are practici
ng this
 hard personally and trust me, they have infinitely many things to do
 apart
 from LM and WM. I think we can be slightly understanding for a coupl
e of
 days more, wish them luck, and pray that they get out hostel LitSoc 
glory.
 I know its an inconvenience, but please do bear with it. Close the w
indow
 and the door  it might help slightly with the sound.

 Cheers!

 Guys,
 This is just to inform you all that I talked to hostel manager
 about the band practice going in the music room. I told him tha
t this is
 very disturbing at least for the rooms just above the music roo
m and
 office. They played till 3 in the morning yesterday night which
 is quite
 disturbing. I asked him to tell these guys ( via Gen.Sec and Li
t.Sec to
 practice in the morning hours (as we all be attending classes) 
and in the
 evening ( 5pm to 8pm). When I asked him what if they played aft
er 8pm, he
 directly told me to call security and inform warden directly ab
out this.
 Hence Music should not be played after 8pm. If it happens, you
 can do the same as well. Call 8080 and warden( his mobile no. i
s outside
 office)
