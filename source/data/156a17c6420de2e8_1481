Tomorrow night we will be kicking off this year's Loose Characters
sessions, with 'Stage Basics' by Krupa Varghese.

Here, we will get into the how and why of managing yourself in the
spotlight, with an emphasis on blocking. An essential basic of theatre,
blocking deals with the positioning and movement of characters more
effectively on stage.
