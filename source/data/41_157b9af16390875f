 All you lazybones and binge watchers behold the event you have been
 waiting for.

 Couch Potatoes 2.0 is here!

 At Comedy Club's very own LitSoc event, get ready for an evening of
 improv comedy, story telling and unexpected twists.

 We assure you this is going to be funnier than the US Presidential
 Election Debate. Or at least, funnier than insti soapbox.

 Come off and witness the antics of hostels Trumping each other in the
 battle to be judged most Hillaryous.

 When? 6:00 PM
 Where? CLT

 Rules: Each hostel is allowed to send a maximum oftwo teams of three
 members each. There will be aprelims and finals round. Further
 details will be intimated to the LitSecs.

 TLDR you couch potato? No preparation needed for the event at all.
 Probably the first time you'll be judged for being funny without a script.


 Regards,
 Team Comedy Club.
