Subject:
Inter-departmental elective on Computational Systems Biology (BT 5240)

Body:
Dear students,

I will be offering an elective on Computational Systems Biology (BT 5240)
 in
the coming semester (JanMay 2016). The course will cover various aspects
of modelling complex systems, with particular emphasis on biological
networks. The course contents are listed below. No prior knowledge
of biology/programming is assumed.

The course flyer can also be downloaded from


The course will be very relevant for undergraduate students (third year
onwards)/MS/PhD students interested in modelling biological systems.
Students from EE/CS/CH may find it particularly interesting. It is one of
the electives for the computational biology minor stream too. The course
also has a significant lab component, with handson sessions on modelling.
