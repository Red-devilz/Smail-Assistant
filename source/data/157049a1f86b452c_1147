Sir,

I had a question regarding why the maximum usable physical memory by 
xv6 and JOS is limited to 2GB(based on KERNBASE) for the two operating 
systems. Why can't the user space be mapped to a larger part of the 
physical memory compared to the kernel space? Example: Considering 4GB 
virtual memory and a 4GB Ram, what prevents us from mapping 
1GB(physical memory) for Kernel and the rest 3GB(physical memory) for 
the User space hence using the entire 4GB  RAM.


Also, the following is the question in JOS Lab2 challenge section :
Write up an outline of how a kernel could be designed to allow user 
environments unrestricted use of the full 4GB virtual and linear 
address space. Hint: the technique is sometimes known as "follow the 
bouncing kernel." In your design, be sure to address exactly what has 
to happen when the processor transitions between kernel and user modes, 
and how the kernel would accomplish such transitions.

Thank you.
