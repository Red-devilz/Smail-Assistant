Hi all
The 4th years and 5th year ED junta, please compile your data seeing the
responses of the RG form. I have already shared the response sheet with
many final years, do take from your friends and if you have your own form-
take data from both hostel RG form and ur form and edit the content. Sit
with your friends for editing and if you need any help in that, do inform
me by sending a mail to my email id. Please send the edited content by *5th
night* or maximum by *6th **April** -12 noon *so that it can be* given for
print after designing it further.*
Regards
Shanttam Jain
