Re: Gangasters Missing Basketball

Body:
Guys!

I put a new basketball rim a week ago and already someone has broken it. It
can be broken only if someone tries to dunk. It is your responsibility to
use these things properly. We do not have budget to keep replacing new
goods. Do not dunk or try stuff like that in the future. Understand that we
have a fixed amount of budget for all these things.

Please use all these facilities properly. Also, the lights are working

Regards
Kaushik

 thats great..

 One more thing, at the time of fixing the rim, please place it atleast at
 the actual court's height. current height is very less compare to original
 court's height.

 Light was working when I checked.
 I'll check it again and make sure it works.

 The basketball rim has arrived. Im waiting for the vendor to give the
 bill before I can get it approved by the warden. I'll get it done by this
 weekend.

 Apologies for the delay

 time you said you had ordered it, Dude, this semester is almost over, how
 many days do we have to wait till we get a new rim..

 Hi all,
 Two days ago, someone took the basketball from hostel's security
 desk when guard was not around..

 Please return the basketball to the security desk...

 Also, don't park your cycles on the basketball court... If you do
 so then you may wonder laterpp why your cycle is not in the same position
 or orientation ..

 Sport Sec, please get a new basketball and fix the court light..
