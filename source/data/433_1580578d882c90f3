Subject:
Gangasters Unavailability of Badminton Racquets

Body:
Hello!

The badminton racquets have been given for repair. Hence, they will not be
available at the watchman's desk. We'll get them back in proper shape in a
couple of days. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Regards
Kaushik
Sports Secretary
