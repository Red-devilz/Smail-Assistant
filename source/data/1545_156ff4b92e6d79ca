Re: Gangasters Project ideas for Hostel

Body:
Keeping monkeys away from the dispenser areas and staircases is the need of
the hour. Let's think about something to shoo them off without physically
harming them, Some Alak people have plastic snakes to scare them off. :P

 Hi Guys,

 I hope everyone would have started studying by now :D
 This year we are going to do something different as compared to past
 years and that will be to Introduce projects at hostel level which
 can be practically implemented in the hostel for the benefit of all
 the students. We have the budget to fund 3 small scale projects and I
 already have ideas for 2 of them.

 Now my motive of sending this mail during quiz week is that during
 this time only we think about all the problems of the universe and di
scuss
 about everything except studies :P

 So if you come up with any of the problem which can be solved by
 technology and that can be implemented in our hostel then you can
 post in this thread during the next 10 days. The work on the project
 will start from 20th Sept.

 All the Best for Quizzes...!!!
