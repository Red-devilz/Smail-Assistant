Hi Vishwanath,

E2B

No classes this week;  but could you please ask everyone in your class to
enter their username in the questionnaire posted on moodle?  That'll let me
conduct the end semester examination and also release the marks in quiz 2.


The end semester syllabus is all that is covered in the course.  It'll be
mostly programming exercises, but also a few objectivetype questions.


The deadline will not be shifted.  I'll allow submissions till the end of
Nov and accept it with linear penalty (so 50% when done at the end of Nov,
100% if done by day before the course end sem).


PS:  Kindly forward this to your class.




Rajsekar
