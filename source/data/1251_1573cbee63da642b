GOOGLE ASIAPACIFIC 2017 UNIVERSITY TEST

We are happy to invite all University students interested in a career at
Google to join our Google AsiaPacific 2017 University Test. All you have
to do is register  and take the
test on your preferred date. But before you do, here are some things to
take note:

   

   Only students enrolled in an University in AsiaPacific or legal
   residents of an AsiaPacific country are eligible to participate.
   

   The dates and times for all tests are available on our schedule page
   .
   

   The next test will happen on Sundays, (on September 18, October 16 &
   November 16)
   

   You can choose to participate in one or all of the tests.
   

   Upon submission, we will review all entries and you may be invited to
   interview with us for internships as well as fulltime roles.

 Important:

    We welcome you to participate in as many tests as you like. To be
   invited for an interview, we consider your best test score (and not the
   average score from across the tests).
    If you are interested in the Software Engineering role, we encourage
   you to participate in the upcoming test on September 18th, since our
   interviewing efforts are in fullswing.


We encourage you to practice before you take the University Test; check
