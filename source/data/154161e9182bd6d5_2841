Hi!

I am staying in Room Number 163, which is right outside the place where
they are practicing. I know that at times, the sound is annoying - I have
felt the same way at times too. But I think its also our responsibility to
do everything we can to facilitate students who are representing our hostel
in LitSoc. I know the junta who are practicing this hard personally and
trust me, they have infinitely many things to do apart from LM and WM. I
think we can be slightly understanding for a couple of days more, wish them
luck, and pray that they get out hostel LitSoc glory. I know its an
inconvenience, but please do bear with it. Close the window and the door -
it might help slightly with the sound.

Cheers!
Venkataraman
