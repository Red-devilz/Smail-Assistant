Dear All,

Athletics is an integral part of the Inter IIT Sports meet. It is very
important for us as it contributes *20 points* to the overall tally.

So, we are planning to conduct the selections for Inter IIT in 3 phases.
Trials will be held at the end of each month - August, September and
October. As part of this, the first trial is scheduled to be held on
Friday, 26 August at 5 PM in the Institute Athletics Stadium.

The events to be conducted are 100 m, 400 m, Long Jump, Triple Jump,1500 m
and Shot Put. The events are open to all the students in the institute.

*Note: For first years who failed to qualify for Athletics** NSO**, you can
use it as an opportunity for direct entry into Athletics NSO. *

For any queries, please contact Bipin Babu (+91 8124586812) or Sowmya (+91
8903694964).

Thank you!

Best regards,
