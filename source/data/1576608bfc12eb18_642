Body:
Dear first years,

I have attached the list of students
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13apBePzJ1OBLbgEUUTqBf1NCAndnyuq7BBJEicj8su8/edit?usp=sharing>
with
multiple selections in NSO. I request these students to give their preference
order <https://goo.gl/forms/F78SEfATL1wTffMh1> through *smail id *before
Wednesday, 28th September. However, the final allocation will be done by
the NSO selection committee taking into consideration both preferences and
availability of slots in different sports.

*Please note that the final list is yet to come and this is just a list of
students with multiple selections. The final NSO list will be out by the
end of this week and everyone can expect NSO to be started from next week.*

Contact me in case of any queries.

Best regards,
*Sethu Madhavan A*
