 Greetings from Shaastra 2017 Team,

 We are having a final leg of Shaastra 2016 Tshirt sales at a discounted
 rate of Rs.150 for all kinds of Tshirts. We have very few Tshirts
 remaining, hence all those who could not grab them during Shaastra can
 avail them now.

 Where?
 Himalaya Ground Floor

 When?
 28th October, Friday from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM

 Payment will be accepted only through cards. Cash will not be accepted.

 Tshirt distribution to the participants of WD Shaastra "Be the eye"
 marathon will also be held at the same time. All those who haven't got a
 Tshirt on that day need to come with their Institute ID card to avail the
 Tshirt. Certificates distribution regarding the same will be held soon.

 Regards,
 Shaastra team,
