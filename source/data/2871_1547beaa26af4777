I can't find any reason for denying the 3:1 system. Naveen, please talk to 
the warden/CCW and get it confirmed.

The argument is simple
There are valuable stuff which if put in common room are sure to get damage
d/stolen. If ccw is ready to take responsibility for them, then it's okay.
Which obviously they won't.
Alternative to that, would be dump rooms on a wing basis,where we would be 
held responsible for our stuff.
Please convey this to the concerned authorities and get back to us . It is 
sad that our campus junta are being asked to take pain for outsiders .

We need budget for cartoon boxes and I will get my budget in next sem only.
 Puneeths remaining budget won't be sufficient for that.

Hi,

Has this system been decided because the rooms are going to be painted in t
he summer? Did CCW give you a reason for not giving one room for every 3 ro
oms and instead giving a the common rooms for dumping? Please clarify. Also
 giving carton boxes is important from the manifesto point of view(which ac
tually no one cares about)

I guess punit might be having some money remaining.
Ask him once. I dont think so the warden should say no for cartons as they 
ensure a better safety of our belongings
