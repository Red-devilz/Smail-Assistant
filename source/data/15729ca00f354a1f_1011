Hello guys,

The *Analytics Club* is back this year with its exciting series of sessions=

Now that the introductory session is over, we are coming up with our first

R is a language that is very useful in data analysis, especially for
beginners, that is very easy to learn and use. In this session we will get
you started with R touching upon the basic syntax and common functions. We
will also go through some data sets and perform basic operations on them.

*Date :* 15/09/2016
*Day : *Thursday
*Venue : *CRC 101
*Time :* 9 PM - 11 PM

We will be working out everything in R. If you don't have R, Use the
following links to download and install R
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> and Rstudio
<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> before you come to the
session.

Install the following packages in R or R Studio by typing the following
commands:
