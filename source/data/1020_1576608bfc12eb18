Subject:
Preference Order | NSO Selections

Body:
Dear first years,

I have attached the list of students

with
multiple selections in NSO. I request these students to give their preference
order  through smail id before
Wednesday, 28th September. However, the final allocation will be done by
the NSO selection committee taking into consideration both preferences and
availability of slots in different sports.

Please note that the final list is yet to come and this is just a list of
students with multiple selections. The final NSO list will be out by the
end of this week and everyone can expect NSO to be started from next week.

Contact me in case of any queries.

Best regards,
