Act Out | SAC Thursday

Body:
Hey Guys!

After a brilliant Loose Character session by Krupa Verghese, Thespian Club
is proud to present the first session of its Act Out series.

This will give all you theatre enthusiasts a wonderful opportunity to act
and direct out bits from select scripts. Its a hands on session and it'll
give a wonderful insight into the making of a play.

Do show up this Thursday (25/08/2016) at the SAC entrance at 6:30 PM
for a ton of fun acting and directing activities.

Cheers,

Thespian Conveners
