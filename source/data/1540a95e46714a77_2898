<strong>Abstract:</strong>=0A=
Zoho Corp employs almost 3000 software engineers. The vast majority,=0A=
well over 90% of them, have no Computer Science degree. About 15% of=0A=
our engineers do not have any degree at all, having come from our=0A=
in-house Zoho University program. Yet, Zoho is holding its own in=0A=
global competition, against the likes of Salesforce and Microsoft. In=0A=
the highly contested global cloud market, Zoho has emerged as a strong=0A=
player, yet we have raised zero venture capital. Zoho challenges=0A=
conventional wisdom in many ways, and in my presentation I would=0A=
highlight some specific insights that I have learned over the past 20=0A=
years, insights which form the foundation of this company. A couple of=0A=
examples would suffice, for those with a Computer Science bent: a)=0A=
software project schedules are not computable b) most decisions you=0A=
face in business (and in life) are formally not decidable c) the most=0A=
important aspects that define a company are not measurable.=0A=
=0A=
I would elaborate on these and other insights in my presentation. =0A=
