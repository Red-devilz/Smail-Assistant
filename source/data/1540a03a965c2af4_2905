*About the KitBoard Summer Internships 2016.*

Expanding on our strong belief in the power of   internet, we have
developed this Internship program to reach out to talent beyond
geographical boundaries. Students will work in teams of 3, along with a
senior member of our team, to accomplish small programming tasks, which
are  designed to match their level of expertise. We will be using advanced
collaboration tools such as Gitlab, Slack and Google Drive . We will be
having a daily online meeting for 5 minutes, and a weekly meeting of 30
minutes to discuss the process (Scrum/Agile fashion).
Thanks and Regards,

Aakash,
Team KitBoard.
