Hi,

Forprob 5c, if M is the total money spent in a day, then my questions ar
e:


1. is M fixed for everyday? or it varies each day depending upon number of
dishes ordered?

2.let's assume the number of heads at one morning is n, then what should
we assume the price for each dish, is it same amount let's say m or it
varies for each n numbers of dishes? is m fixed for everyday and every
single dish?

Thanks:)
