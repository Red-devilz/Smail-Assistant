Re: ET Startup Awards 2016: 4 IITMIC incubatees makes it to Top 5
 finalists under 'Campus Startup' category

Dear All,


Congratulations to Ather Energy (Tarun Mehta 
and Swapnil Jain) for winning the Economic Times Startup Award 2016, 'Best 
on Campus' category, and IITM Incubation.


Jury comments are interesting:

The Best on Campus category E2 where startups founded in colleges ar
e recognised E2 came in for attention and praise. IITMadras was esp
ecially singled out because four out the five in the shortlist were born on
 the Chennai campus. The eventual winner, Ather Energy, was one of them. Ho
sanagar actually wanted IITMadras to be awarded a prize.
Times Internet ViceChairman Satyan Gajwani described the Best on Campus ca
tegory as "pretty amazing" for throwing up interesting surprises. "It is ve
ry interesting to see the kind of innovations coming out from these college
 campuses. It wasn't the usual 'Let's build an ecommerce company'. It's di
sruptive and different," he said.
