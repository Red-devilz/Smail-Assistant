GMO is a hydrophobic <brfoodgrade lipid that forms a variety of equilibrium phases. Of particular interest are the bicontinuous phases, since they can be used to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. I will discuss our work on  cubosomes, viz. lipid nanoparticles with internal cubic phase structure and demonstrate how coating with a single polymer layer renders them as powerful theranostic entities. To overcome the limitations of burst release from such cubosomes, we explore the possibility of producing discontinuous<brcubic phase inverse structures using the same lipidwater system. We<brdemonstrate that polar molecules that (i) have a compact molecular architecture and (ii) have attractive interactions with the lipid head group can induce discontinuous micellar cubic phases in the system at room temperature. This is unprecedented since it was previously believed that this could be achieved only by addition of apolar oils. Finally, I will discuss an interesting application of cubosomes dispersions as lowsplash effective delivery agents on hydrophobic surfaces.
