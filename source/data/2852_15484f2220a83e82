Body:
b'     Dear friends,   This is to inform you all that Dr. Suresh Babu (HSS) has handed over charge as Advisor, Weaker Section to Dr. Samuel (ME) this week.   We wish to thank Dr. Suresh for the services he has rendered quietly resolving many conflicts that students brought before him. Many PWD candidates benefited by his timely action with regard to providing aids for their better stay at IITM.    We also take this opportunity to welcome Dr. Samuel (ME) as Advisor, Weaker Section. I already see his enthusiasm in making it a comfortable stay for students from the Weaker Section.              Anbudan,  Siva (Sivakumar Srinivasan) Dean of Students (DoSt), IIT Madras.
