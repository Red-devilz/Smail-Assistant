Subject: Re: computational photography (EE5176) course details
To: cscouncillor@smail.iitm.ac.in


Please also mention that the course will have programming assignments or
projects based on Matlab. Working knowledge of image processing is a
prerequisite. You need not have taken a formal course but you should have
some practical experience in image processing.

thanks
