Subject:
Internships during the semester

Body:
Hey,

I wanted to introduce you to work from home internships that provide you
access to real life work while you are still in college. Such internships
usually require 23 hours of work commitment and last for 1  2 months. At
Internshala, we have over 3800 work from home internships for you to choose
from. We have them in domains like engineering, management, design, media
among others.

The best part  it's completely free and you get paid to do the internship

If interested, you can create an account here (
registration/student?utm_sourceISP6&utm_mediumISP6209PRA) and start
applying to internships.

PS  We also have full time internship opportunities with us. Internshala
is completely free for students and all internship listed come with stipend
and certificate.

Regards,
Pranjal,
Internshala Student Partner
