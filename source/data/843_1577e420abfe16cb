Hello Neeraj,

Sorry for the late reply. It is logistically difficult to get the room and
coordinators to teach and get a time where a lot of people are free again.
This is only our second session and it is better that it not delayed any
more.
For those who are not able to make it to the session, we put up material in
the fb group for what we have covered.
