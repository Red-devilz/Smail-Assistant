Re: Gangasters Dear gangasters,

@Ravi  Good. You could also go ahead and ask everybody else whether they
have stolen it. The first guy who says "yes" is your man.

 @Sahil bro, I am disappointed that you have failed again. :P

 Our elders recommend that we avoid 12AM/12PM, but there's nothing
 incorrect about it.

 Interestingly, it can also be argued differently  using your adopted
 philosophy that nothing is right or wrong, it's just an experience. So
 12AM/12PM both are just experiences.

 I think we are going off the topic here with AM and PM. Theft from
 someone belonging to IITM is really very shameful.

 For the past few days, someone has been stealing my newspaper from
 the entrance of my room (334). Today also he did the same. The newspaper
 guy drops it off  around 8:00 am but I am down to pick it up only after
 12:00 am because of my class schedule, so it is not as if the paper sits
 outside all day.
 If any gangaster guy is doing this, then please stop it because
 someday or another I would be able to catch you.

 Dude, if you wanna read newspaper then I) start visiting the first
 room near the ganga entrance or ii)  later in the evening come to my room
 (334) to pick up the newspaper after I'm finished or the best one iii)start
 your own subscription.
