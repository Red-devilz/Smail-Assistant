Hello everyone,

Greetings from the Comedy Club, IITM.

It's time to put your fundaes from the Stand Up Workshop into practice and
wait-for-it ... have more fun. We welcome you the first ever session of
Comedy Club IIT Madras' Punchline,

So, what's in store for you this time?

An opportunity to test out your stand-up material in front of like minded
peers. Bring your rough/prototype/undigested jokes and ideas and have them
workshopped and fine tuned before you go up on stage. You will receive
feedback from fellow humorists and maybe even a surprise guest (read:
established stand-up comic). This is especially recommended for those of
you who may want to perform at our upcoming Comedy Club Open Mics.

Following these LOLs will be more LOLS in the form of an improv game
session which, needless to say, will take fun to a whole new level.

TL;DR : Punchline Session 1 = Entertainment, entertainment and only
entertainment :P.

Date: *Tuesday, 23rd August*.

Venue : *CRC 301*

Timings: *7-9pm*

See you there!

Cheers,

Comedy Club, IITM
