Dear all,

The survey results are as follows.

1)A total of 2773 responses were received which is about 30% of the entire
student community
2)90% of total students, 93% of boy students, 73% of girl students, 82% of
Tunga residents, 69% of Sharavathi+Sarayu+Sabarmathi residents told 'Yes'

Eventhough we didn't receive 50% of student responses, we had a discussion
with the administration about opening Himalaya for girls and Vindhya for
Boys. After a long discussion, it was finally decided to make registration
of messes in Himalaya available to girl students online.

From now onwards, *girl students can register for all the messes online
except Cauvery*. However, the limited vacancies available after allotting
boy students in Himalaya will only be given to girls. Hence, there are
chances that a girl student gets Vindhya even if her first options are
Himalaya messes.

We hope this will be a relief for many girl students, especially those
students residing in Tunga.

Thanks to Purab (SGS) for his support throughout.
