Reg. UGC/CSIR Fellowships

Body:
This mail is only for MS and PhD Scholars under UGC/CSIR Fellowship
schemes. Others can kindly ignore.

Dear Scholars,

The UGC and CSIR fellowships will be credited directly to scholars' account
effectively from July 1st. There are some bottlenecks in this transition.

We will let you know more details by Aug 6th.
