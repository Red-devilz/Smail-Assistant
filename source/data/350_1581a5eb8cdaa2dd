 Diwali, when given that there was no Puja, crackers, diyas, lightings
 etc...?

 Hi,
 I thought the decision was taken to organize extra night to utilize the
 residue funds but not to replace the existing thing. Moreover, I do see ,in
 the existing budget 3000 Rs alloted for Diwali. Also, there are not two but
 three festivals mentioned in GBM. PFA.
 Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks.
