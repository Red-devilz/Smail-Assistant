Dear all,

Find below information regarding DD/MTech/BTech internship from ABB. Please
note that MTech final year and DD final year are eligible for this
internship.

* We urgently need applications for the same in a day or two (max Sunday).
Kindly collate the applications and send them to Prof Krishna Vasudevan
(and cc to me as well). You may notify the students that the selection will
