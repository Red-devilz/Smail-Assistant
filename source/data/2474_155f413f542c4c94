Subject:
Require speakers of Santali, Mundari, and Ho (Austro-Asiatic
 languages) for my research

Body:
Dear friends,
I am Mayuri, from HHS department.

My research is relating to investigation in three tribal languages such as
Santali, Mundari, and Ho.

I would be glad, if any of you are from Jharkhand, or West Bengal, and can
provide me certain information, how I can contact the speakers, and their
community, in order to collect data in these languages.

As far as I know, there should be certain villages in Jharkhand, and West
Bengal. Providing me with any information about their communities would
help.

I would be grateful, if anyone can help me in this regard.

Thank you,

Sincerely,

Mayuri
