Dear friends,

We are planning to have a t-shirt for our running club, Forest Gumps. The
design is available in the attached form. The material will be dry-fit,
which is comfortable for long runs. They are expected to cost around Rs
300-400 per t-shirt. We will place the order once we have an estimate of
how many t-shirts we want, and then get back to you with size and payment
details. Please do fill the attached form if you are interested!
