ABSTRACT :

Comprehension of light transport mechanism in a turbid medium such as biolo
gical tissue, is  important in the field of biomedical optical spectroscopy
. It facilitates diagnostic, therapeutic and characterisation applications 
by using optical fibers in a non invasive modality. Light transport study i
n random media is crucial to the estimation of various optical properties e
ither using theoretical methods or models which perform iterative optimisat
ion of optical properties from experimental data. Optical properties such a
s scattering, absorption and anisotropy, have relationships with microphysi
cal structure and biochemical aspects of biological media under investigati
on.  Optical scattering forms the backbone of light propagation in random m
edia along with absorption. Scope of the study done is to understand light 
transport phenomenon in random media, accounting for pair correlated or dep
endent scattering and developing inverse transport models for quantifying o
ptical scattering accurately using fiber probes in reflectance mode, which 
would be compatible in the context of noninvasive probing. Third order sph
erical harmonics approximation to 3D Boltzmann radiative transport equation
 using fiber probes in a slab medium is used for  quantification of effecti
ve optical scattering of various dilutions of Intralipid20% (used as a low
 cost standard scattering phantom) using spatially resolved reflectance spe
ctroscopy. Inverse Monte Carlo method for light transport is also used to o
btain the concentration dependent scattering profile.  Scattering profile o
f concentrated dilutions are validated using analytic wave scattering theor
y and effective medium theory. Results obtained using various methods are c
ompared, advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
