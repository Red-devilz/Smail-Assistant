Hi freshies,

Do you know that IITM is inclusive to all genders and sexualities?

We have a group called Vannam (meaning colour) which is a student group to
address the issues faced by the LGBTQIA community in the campus. It is open
to everyone in the insti. There is a Google group which anyone can join

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vannam-iitm

What do we do? Vannam creates a friendly atmosphere in the campus for the
LGBTQIA students. We meet regularly to discuss and solve any issues faced
by the students due to their gender and sexuality, and/or physical
appearance and gait. Yes, we also have good time eating at Zaitoon and CCD.

If you feel different and face issues, please do not hesitate to contact
us. Emails to lgbtqia@iitm.ac.in will be kept anonymous.

Accept yourself as yourself. Accept your friends as themselves. Accept your
fellow students as fellow humans, however different they are from your
single perspective.

Appreciate diversity. Do not be mean. Deviations are indeed standard.

Official email for any help, suggestions, and feedback: lgbtqia@iitm.ac.in
