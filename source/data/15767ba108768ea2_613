Respected Sir

   I am currently dining in Marvel (Himalaya, Ground Floor) and was
planning to take Jain Food in Zenith (in Mandakini hostel) for next month
due to Navratra when I avoid eating onion and Garlic. In view of present
decision, is it possible for me to make a request to change my mess from
Marvel to Zenith (Jain) for two weeks of October ?


Regards
Sumit Kumar
