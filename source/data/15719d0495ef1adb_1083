Hallo!

On behalf of the Student Legislative Council, I thank you all for your
overwhelming response to the survey on Drug Testing for Elected
Representatives. Every student's opinion matters, and I assure you that the
Student Legislative Council shall keep the results of this survey in mind
while deciding on this policy.

Please find below the response sheet of the survey. 54% of the 1311
students who filled the form have voted for this policy.

Hoping to see similar enthusiasm for all future surveys conducted by the
Student Legislative Council!

Cheers!
Venkataraman
