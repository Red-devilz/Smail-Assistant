 Hello wonderful people of the institute!

 Have you ever wanted to see your friends perform extremely hard to try
 make you laugh or gain your approval of their sense of humor?

 If yes, then please come and witness IITM's first ever Stand  up Open
 Mic. We guarantee you laughter, if not, we'll do it at the artist's
 expense. It'll be fun.

 If no, come anyway, for "There is no better feeling. than the one you get
 when you heckle an anonymous speaker and steal all the laughter, and the
 glory."  The Opposition.

 The event will be held on Tuesday, September 20th. Performers have been
 selected on a first come first serve basis and will be expected to perform
 sets that are no longer than 4 mins. You can heckle if you like, but please
 try something other than 'your mom' jokes. They are getting old, just like
 your mom.
 Regards,
 Team Comedy Club
