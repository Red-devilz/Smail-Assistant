Dear Friends,

Greetings and wishes for a great semester. As many of you might know, we
offered Heartfulness Relaxation and Meditation last semester through our
Leisure Time Activity Program (LTAP) course.

Over 100 of our students have been exposed to this and it has been quite
helpful to many of us in our day-to-day effectiveness. Saathi also
conducted a summer course on the same that many students took up.

For the next semester, this will be offered (1) through LTAP between 6 to 7
pm on Thursdays at CCW. You are encouraged to enrol for this and experience
the benefit and (2) every Sunday, we have group meditation between 9.30-10.30
am. Again, all are welcome, especially those who have been through the LTAP
course.

For further queries, contact me at phanikaran01@gmail.com,

The course is conducted by our own Alums and you will enjoy it.

Regards,
Pankaj and Phani (On behalf of Saathi)
