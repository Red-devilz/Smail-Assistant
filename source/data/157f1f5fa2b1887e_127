Hey All !

Greetings from the *Computer Vision Group* and the* Centre **for
Innovation,*

Have you ever wondered what distinguishes a human eye from a camera.
Wondered why your PC which can do a billion operations in a second can't
make sense of an image while we ourselves who can barely multiply two
numbers in a second can make much more sense of an image?

If these questions interests you, don't miss the session at PPT Hall this
Thursday. We will be conducting the third session for the Computer Vision
Group for this year. It will be a* hands on session with OpenCV in python*.
So bring your laptops *fully charged with opencv installed*. But do turn up
even if you don't have a laptop.

For those who haven't installed opencv you can get the installation
instructions from here

.

Date,Time and Place:* 27**th of October*, from *6:00pm to 8:30pm* at* PPT*
* Hall* (behind DoST office, near entrance to Mathematics section of HS
department)

Cheers!
