The question reads

" For this experiment, use only forest and mountain classes in DS2. Perform
2class
Logistic Regression on it. Report perclass precision, recall and fmeasure
on the same
test data you used to test the neural net work... "

The Neural Network part is by accident, right? Or do we have to train a
neural network on the given dataset too?
