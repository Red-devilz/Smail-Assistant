 Hello!

 This is regarding designs for the Hostel Jersey! This year, we shall be
 getting better quality jerseys at a cheaper price since we have a common
 vendor for all the hostels.

 Hence, we need to give the vendor the jersey design order ASAP.

 We shall have a Jersey Design Competition with the winner getting a
 free jersey and a cash prize of Rs. 500. The jersey getting the highest
 number of votes shall be deemed the winner.

 Deadline: November 8th 11:59 pm

 PFA: Designs from last year
