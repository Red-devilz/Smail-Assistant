 Hi Vamshi
     Long time. How are you doing? We are looking for summer interns from
 IITM as we did during the winters. It would be of great help if you can
 forward this email for information related to internships at Wishup for C
SE
 folks at IITM.

      We are an early stage startup founded by IITMIIMA alums and are
 looking for smart CS individuals from IITM for internships in domains
 related to MLAI, Full stack development, Android and iOS.

 Wishup is a smart personal chat assistant through whom users can use to
 get their stuff done. For example, an user can ask Wishup to get grocerie
s,
 book his flight tickets, book a table, fetch an electrician and so on.

 We have around 30k customers across platforms such as Android, iOS and
 Facebook.

 The various projects that we have in our hands are

 1) Chatbots :

 This involves developing a bot which can talk to users automatically, ask
 relevant questions and place the orders for the users. People who are
 interested in ML, AI, NLP can apply to work on this project. You will be
 building chatbots that will be live on Facebook, Telegram, Hike and our
 Native Wishup's Android and iOS app.

 2) OpsDashboard :

 This involves building a scalable internal webapplication realtime tool
 for the Operators in the backend. The tool essentially does the following
:

 Enable operators engage users through chat.
 Enable operators to track and update statuses of various
 requests.(CRMbased tool)
 The work also revolves more upon coming up with smart logics in alerting
 mechanisms of a new request (or) a chat message.

 People who have experience of working with Node.js with Sails/Express are
 encouraged to apply for this profile.

 3) Android/iOS:

 This involves adding cool new features to our native apps which are in an
 early stage.

 People who are interested in Android/iOS are encouraged to apply for this
 profile.

 We are based out of Delhi and our office(gmaps) is very close to IITD
 campus.

 If you guys want more insight on the company or the projects, feel free t
o
 give me a call or drop a mail.

 Thanks
