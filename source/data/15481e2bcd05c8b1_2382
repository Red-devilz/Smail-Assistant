ABSTRACT :	=


Biophotonics is a new and vastly promising field providing better solutions=
 to lingering diagnostics challenges. Replacing or reducing invasive and pa=
inful procedures with optical techniques is being heavily pondered. Behavio=
ur of light interaction with biological tissue gives information regarding =
the morphological structure of the tissue. Polarization property  of light =
is found to be useful in  this regard.  While the Stokes vector describe th=
e state of polarization of light source, Mueller calculus is used to define=
 the way in which the  incident light polarization state is transformed by =
the tissue, which is essentially an optical medium. The changes occurring i=
n the tissue ultrastructure during disease progression such as malignant gr=
owth reflects total tissue optical scattering properties which could be cha=
racterized from the derived Mueller matrix value. In the study, we probe ho=
w changes are incurred in the Mueller matrix and derived indicators of a ti=
ssue during expected morphological changes in the subcellular structure dur=
ing a neoplastic growth.

Experimentally obtained Mueller matrix and depolarisation index parameters =
of normal and tumor tissue phantom samples show distinguishable difference.=
 It is observed that the tissue Mueller matrix and its derived components a=
re insensitive to tissue absorption, thus eliminating the interference effe=
cts of absorption in tissue scattering measurement. For further investigati=
on and understanding of these differences that is contributed by the tissue=
 total scattering, an optical model of the tissue is computationally simula=
ted. The motivations for the model are derived from the histopathological c=
hanges in the tissue during cancer progression. The nucleus size undergoes =
an approximate doubling while cell crowding in unit probed tissue volume in=
creases during the development of cancer. Modeling the cell nuclei as main =
scattering centers, a systematic computational study using Monte carlo meth=
od on how Mueller matrix elements vary for an increase in scatterer size an=
d number density is performed.  It is possible to selectively discriminate =
the changes in the overall scattering, giving more insight to its contribut=
ing factors such as size and volume fraction of the nucleus during the deve=
lopment of malignancy. =
