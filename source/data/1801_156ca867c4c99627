Hello Freshies!

Time for some tennis!

Freshie (UG & PG) Schroeter for tennis (Men) is scheduled on 27.08.2016 (
Saturday) and tennis (Women) on 28.08.2016 (Sunday) at 4 30 PM in the
institute tennis court.

Prior tennis knowledge is not required. Tennis courts are nowhere near the
nofun zone. So don't be shy to gear up your kits, brush up on your strokes
and turn up for Schroeter in loads!

For any queries, please contact Keerthana (+91 99401 13540) or Aneesh (+91
90499 15088).

Thank you!
