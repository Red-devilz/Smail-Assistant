 Hello everyone,

 We are releasing a new student survey, this time on data privacy within
 the institute. This is a very short form, do take out a minute to fill and
 also share it widely! It will be used in a wider article discussing data
 privacy concerns in the institute.

 Warm regards,
 The T5E Team
