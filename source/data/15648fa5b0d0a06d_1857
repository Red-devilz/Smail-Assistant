=E2=80=8BHello everyone,

As the tests for internships are going to commence in some time, it is
highly advised that your resumes are prepared as soon as possible and are
reviewed by your peers and seniors.

Based on the company one is aiming for, each student can have more than one
resume. Students interested in non-core profile are advised to have atleast
two resumes, atleast one each for core and non-core. There is no fixed
template, but using the Institute template is advisable.

Documents which will help in writing a resume and sample resumes have been
shared in the mail. Please refer to them for necessary changes.
