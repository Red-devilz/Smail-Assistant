 Hello!

 Get your state of mind out of yesterday's huff and puff and running and
 funning of Queen of Sheebs and enter the zone for the second Litsoc event
 of the semester:Creative Writing  Solo! PFA the prompts (of which
 you're supposed to choose one and send in works of fiction hostel wise) and
 (all) the rules (there are).

 Deadline is SEPTEMBER 26 MONDAY 11:59 PM which is a lot of time for
 writing prose/poetry if you start write now!

 It won't take much time, except maybe at the beginning, to come up with an
 idea before picking up your pen or hitting the keyboard. It's anyway
 supremely easier than finding ccd beans or editing ccd beans and/or wearing
 lipstick :) So make sure you get in touch with your hostel litsec about
 this.

 All the best everyone! Bring out the Hunter and the Scotty in you, tho the
 Twain shall never meet. Let's string some words into phrases and end up
 with some fab writing!

 Cheers,
 Writing Club 201617
