Hola junta!

Time flies in Insti - Quiz I just got over and soon you will have Quiz II
to deal with. Amidst all this academic ruckus ;fun-filled and awe-inspiring
events are a welcome respite.

So Shaastra invites you all for a fun filled evening at Himalaya on 22nd
September! Interesting activities and cool gadgets awaits to catch your eye=
.

There is something for everyone, from physical participation to exercising
your brain's grey cells (some of you might even get nostalgic). Moreover,
superhero frolic joins the show.

If that is not enough there's colour to please your aesthetic sense and to
reveal something quite peculiar and interesting.

So meet you all tomorrow evening at Himalaya at 7:30pm.
