>
> *ABSTRACT*
>
> The high fidelity acquisition and modern processing technology allow the
> applications of Quantitative Seismic Interpretation (or Quantitative
> Interpretation- QI) to grow fast in Reservoir Geophysics discipline in E&=
P
> Industry for last few years. Integration of data from different disciplin=
es
> plays key role in Quantitative Interpretation and consequently field
> development plans by reducing the reservoir uncertainties. Presently, QI
> workflow is being used in every stage of Geophysical activities for field=
=E2=80=99s
> development plan. In exploration, it is used in prospect identification,
> hydrocarbon uncertainty analysis, selection of exploration well locations
> and Probability of Success (PoS) analysis. In appraisal and development
> stages, it is used for fluid and contact analysis, reservoir facies
> distribution, reservoir properties distribution, development well placeme=
nt
> and Volumetric & Reserves estimation. Finally, at the production stage,
> integration with geological, petrophysical, geo-mechanical and reservoir
> engineering data, a Reservoir Geophysicist (QI) would be able to provide
> reservoir continuity, undrained reserves, new potential infill well
> locations and in some cases subsidence prediction as well. In the present
> talk; applications of QI at different stage of geophysical activities in
> field development plan, will be discussed along with some examples from t=
he
> projects which I have been associated with in my last 10 years.

> *About the Speaker*
>
> Dr Pankaj Tiwari obtained his PhD from Indian Institute of Technology
> Bombay in 2008. Post PhD, he was hired by Shell oil company as Geophysici=
st
> for Shell=E2=80=99s newly established technology hub in Bangalore. He was=
 an
> integral part of their Global Center of Expertise. Dr. Tiwari was
> associated with exploration and development projects from Gulf of Mexico,
> Brazil, Nigeria, Canadian Beaufort Sea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia,
> Brunei, Pakistan and North Sea. He carried out several Stochastic and
> Deterministic Seismic Inversions for Reservoir continuity and property
> prediction to help appraisal and development projects. *Dr. Pankaj Tiwari
> joined OMV Tunisia in January 2013 on an* *expatriate assignment, to
> supervise geophysical operations and train the fresh inductees in Petrole=
um
> Engineering Department.*
