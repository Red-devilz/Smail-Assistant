Dear Students,

Ifyou want to have any assignment reevaluated, we will go by the
following guidelines:

1.you must goto the TA (emailing the code will not be accepted) and make
all the changes in person sitting next to the TA.

2.The TA will note down the changes made.

3.The TA will run the code and inform the student of how many testcases
passing.

4.The TA will inform the instructor of the changes made and the instruct
or
will decide on the penalty.

Warmregards,
Krishna.
