I got feedback on this from my colleagues and they believed that it would work for them. As for the meetings with the students, the primary aim is to inform them of what we can offer in these specific fields if they would like to visit Sweden and Umea as exchange students, also what would be possible if they are interested in a research carrier. Since the professors in question will introduce their own areas of expertise, the talks will be mostly limited to these areas. I believe that they will be able to adjust their presentations to the present audience. Their research will be in focus when we meet your faculty members. I have encouraged all of them to look up your facultyC2B4s profiles, more than once, I hope to send you their lists ASAP:  </span  They are certainly interested in the Research Park if it is possible to incorporate it in the tour!  </span  Warm regards, Lennart  </span    FrC3A5n:  International Relations [mailto:oir@iitm.ac.in]  Skickat:  den 22 september 2016 14:10  Till:  Lennart Johansson <lennart.johansson@umu.se  Kopia:  Rupali Bhalerao <rupali.bhalerao@umu.se; Thomas Mejtoft <thomas.mejtoft@umu.se; Anders C3strand <anders.astrand@umu.se; Lennart Edblom <edblom@cs.umu.se  C3mne:  Re: Update UMU visit      Dear Lennart Johansson,    Can we plan all the visits and meetings on 29th September and 28th Sept. we can organise meeting with Students in the evening. Please confirm if this meeting with students is to promote Umea University program or research specific talks.

I notice that the visit starts at 10.30&nb;sp; the 29 th , which I suspect is welcome news for Dr Edholm that arrives late the 28 th . We do however, have an option to meet already the 28 th  perhaps after lunch, since we do arrive late the 27 th  or early in the morning of Wednesday the 28 th .  </span  Would it be possible to perhaps arrange for a visit to your Department of Building Technology and Construction Management with a focus on Functional Design of Buildings? I suspect that Dr Astrand would be particularly interested!  I also wonder if we will be able to have any interaction with your students and in particular Dr Mejtoft area of Interaction and Design. Both these scholars will arrive the 28 th  and available for some activities within their respective fields (Energy Engineering (esp in Buildings) and Interaction & Design. </span I am also not sure if you are aware of that Dr Mejtoft also expects to meet with James Rajanayagam, Project Consultant, Centre for Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship as part of his proposed participation in your Winter school. Perhaps Wednesday would be a good meeting time for this? </span </span Thank you for your help! </span Lennart </span </span   FrC3A5n: b  International Relations [ mailto:oir@iitm.ac.in ]  Skickat:  den 21 september 2016 15:44  Till:  Lennart Johansson < lennart.johansson@umu.se   C3mne:  Re: Update UMU visit   Dear Lennart Johansson,  Please find the tentative list and let me know if you need any changes.
