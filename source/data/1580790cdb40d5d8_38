Greetings from Shaastra 2017 Team,

We are having a final leg of Shaastra 2016 T-shirt sales at a discounted
rate of *Rs.150* for all kinds of T-shirts. We have very few T-shirts
remaining, hence all those who could not grab them during Shaastra can
avail them now.

Where?
*Himalaya Ground Floor*

When?
*28th October, Friday from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM*

Payment will be accepted only through cards. Cash will not be accepted.

T-shirt distribution to the participants of *WD- Shaastra "Be the eye"
marathon* will also be held at the same time. All those who haven't got a
T-shirt on that day need to come with their Institute ID card to avail the
T-shirt. Certificates distribution regarding the same will be held soon.

Regards,
Shaastra team,
