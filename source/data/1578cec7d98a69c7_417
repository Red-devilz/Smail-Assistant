*About the Speaker:*

Thirumavalavan is Tamil activist, Member of Parliament in 15th Lok Sabha
and the current President of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi. He rose to
prominence in the 1990s as a Dalit leader, and entered politics in 1999.
His political platform centres on ending the caste-based oppression of the
Dalits. He did his Bachelor's course in chemistry, masters degree in
Criminology and completed law at Madras Law College.  Oppression of Dalits,
he says, is institutionalised in India, including Tamil Nadu and he has
spent his lifetime in fighting caste-based oppression.
