Body:
b'      Dear IITM Students,  For many decades, blood cancer was considered incurable.Today, with great advancements in Science and Medicine, a patient with blood cancer or any other serious blood disorder can be cured with a blood stem cell transplant.  Common people like you and me, can donate our blood stem cells to such patients and give them a second chance at life.  It is my pleasure to introduce you to DATRI Blood Stem Cell Donors Registry.  DATRI is anot for profit organisation founded in 2009 to help patientssuffering from fatal blood disorders like blood cancer and Thalassemia find a matched donor. There are over 1,60,000 registered donors. However, there is an urgent need for more donors as the number of patients looking for a match is increasing rapidly.  C3BC ; Are you18  50 years and healthy? C3BC ; Do you have a kind heart to care? C3BC ; Some time to spare?   The best part is three of our donors who already donated their blood stem cells will be honoured by DATRI in the same occasion. Hear it from the Heroes!R;    with regards, Mahalakshmi  '
