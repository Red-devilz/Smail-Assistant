CH5350

Body:
Dear Students

(all B. Tech. / DD students from 5th semester and higher, and all PG
students)

Classes for CH5350: Applied TimeSeries Analysis (being offered in the E2
FE2
slot) will take place at NPTEL Studio 1 (IC & SR, 3rd floor). Students
who cannot be accommodated in Studio 1 will be seated in the adjacent
Conference
Room (on the same floor), where the class will be telecasted with facility
for teacherstudent interaction. The reason for the change of venue (from
MSB 240) is that a video recording of the course is scheduled to be offered
as a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) during the JanMay 2016 semester.

Classes begin on Wednesday, August 03, 2016 at 11:00 AM.

Thank you for your cooperation. I look forward to seeing all of you
tomorrow.

best wishes,
Arun
