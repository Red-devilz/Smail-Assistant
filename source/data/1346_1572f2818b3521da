b'               IIT Madras has a unique natural heritage. To celebrate and document this natural heritage, the Heritage Centre along withPrakriti, Wildlife Club, IITM is organising a special workshop in which participants will be exposed to theory and practical techniques of photography and documentation.  There will be both lectures and outdoor photography sessions, followed by reviews of the results. A basic introduction to insects and flowers will also be provided.   No prior knowledge or experience with photography or nature is required. Each participant must bring a camera to the workshop. This camera could be of any type: SLR, bridge or even a mobile phone.  The workshop will be led by Mr. Venkataraaman, better known as PoochiVenkat. He has been photographing and documenting microfauna for the past 22 years. PoochiVenkat is also a pioneer in audio engineering, hailing from a family with a strong involvement with music.  His professional work includes digitisation and restoration of old photographs, negatives and transparencies.   This unique workshop will provide an understanding of the principles of photography and familiarity with digital cameras. Participants can expect the quality of their photographs to vastly improve as a result of this workshop experience.  They will also be in a position to handle sophisticated photographic equipment effectively and with confidence.  Participation will provide the foundation for a deeper appreciation of nature also.   Attendance on both days is expected. The number of participants is limited to 20 .   To register, please send an email to prakriti@iitm.ac.in before 22 September 5PM. Dropping out is discouraged.       '
