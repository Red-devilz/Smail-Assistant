Readoin : A second hand book fair

Body:
Hello all,

We are a bunch of students at IIT madras working on a start up named '
Readoin'. We, at Readoin, want to ignite reading culture in our campus by
selling used books (Academics, Exam preparation, Novels etc.) on an E
commerce platform.

In order to initiate our plans, we are planning to launch a pilot model in
institute. We want to publicize our vision through a Book fair near
Himalaya mess once in a month.Therefore, we have made plans to set up our
first stall near Himalaya on 26th Aug, Friday in 2 slots (11am  2pm, 6pm
 9pm) having wide varieties of most famous novels of all time.

We strongly recommend people to give a visit during mess hours at book fair
and grab your favorite novels as soon as possible. First come first serve!

Like our facebook page to be updated regarding offers on books and upcoming
events.
