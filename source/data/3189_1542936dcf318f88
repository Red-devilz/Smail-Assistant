b'     Hi,     What is energy medicine? I have never heard of it.According to wikipedia:     Energy medicine , energy therapy, energy healing, or spiritual healing are branches of alternative medicine . The most controversial claim in this general area of pseudoscience is the belief healers can channel healing energy into a patient and effect positive results    Energy is measured in Joules (SI units)  this is what I teach in my courses. How does one measure healing energy?
