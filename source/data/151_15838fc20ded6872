 Hi guys,

 IIT Madras Quiz Club will play host to the LitSoc Fandom Quiz tomorrow.
 We promise to take you on a fun ride through the universes of Hogwarts,
 Middle Earth, Westeros and Asgard. If any of those words got you excited,
 you NEED to be at HSB today! (6/11/16).

 Here's your chance to jump headfirst again into some of the treasured
 memories from your childhood. So grab 2 other people, get a pen and make
 your way to the event! Fret not if you dont have a team... Just turn up
 at the event, and we'll find you one.

 Where? HSB 334
 When? Sunday, the 6th of November. 6:30 PM.

 Regarding any queries, feel free to contact Sukruth (9790469683).

 Hoping to see you all there,
 IITM Quiz Club.




 Warm Regards,
