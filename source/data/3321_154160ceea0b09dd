 @SOHIT JATAIN, first of all I sympathize with you for all the troubles
 you are going through. It is a crime to play loud music at residential
 areas at 3:00 am at night. The person who asked you to leave your room and
 study at library should himself go and play his music on streets. You have
 every right to call police (just dial 100) in case they disturb you again
 at night.
 I am shocked to see that everybody is neglecting the problem of this
 student. It is really shameful.

 @Tapan
 Ist : I went to these guys and what they said was intolerable. They
 said "some study @ night and some study during day, we had no perfect time
 to practice, so we started practicing both times. Near GC, we have insti
 library, go study there"
 2nd: Went to manager, told the problem, he asked me to talk to lit sec.
 and I did. And then I asked manager for the 3rd option, he told me to
 contact warden directly.

 They showed me the way. So did I.

 And as far as adjusting is concerned, I was adjusting with the situaion
 from past two days and that was more than enough
  for me. There is a time for everything. You can't just start making
 noises @ 1 or 2 am.

 This is juvenile behaviour. You could have just asked the guys who
 were playing if they could just reduce the volume. Just because you are not
 participating in some thing, does not mean it is not important for others.
 If these guys are giving up on their sleep and practising for an event,
 then it probably means quite a lot to them. In a hostel, learn to adjust to
 the community life and do not be a prick.

 Thanx Samir.
 As far as my argument is concerned.
 Once Shoaib Akhtar said for Dravid  " You can bowl any bowl to him,
 he will just leave it. But once you bowl him a bowl worth boundary, he will
 definitely give you a boundary"
 So I will definitely reply a comment that is worth replying.

 be? This be hostel life bro. Gotta adjust :)

 Guys,
 This is just to inform you all that I talked to hostel manager
 about the band practice going in the music room. I told him that this is
 very disturbing at least for the rooms just above the music room and
 office. They played till 3 in the morning yesterday night which is quite
 disturbing. I asked him to tell these guys ( via Gen.Sec and Lit.Sec to
 practice in the morning hours (as we all be attending classes) and in the
 evening ( 5pm to 8pm). When I asked him what if they played after 8pm, he
 directly told me to call security and inform warden directly about this.
 Hence Music should not be played after 8pm. If it happens, you
 can do the same as well. Call 8080 and warden( his mobile no. is outside
 office)
