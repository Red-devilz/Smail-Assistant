Binary operators
by CS14B028 SRINIDHI PRABHU  Saturday, 5 November 2016, 5:20 PM

1) For addition, should we use with overflow or without overflow?

2)For shift operations, is it logical shift or arithmetic shift?

3)For returning, should we use " j $ra"(as given in the public cases) or
"jr $ra"(as Mars expects it)?
