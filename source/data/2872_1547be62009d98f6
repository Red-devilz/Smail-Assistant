Re: Gangasters Levelling of Quadrangle or Outdoor Gymnasium

Body:
The volleyball court is in quite good shape. It makes sense to use the
budget on other stuff.

 Instead of a cafeteria functioning alongside the already existing
 jamuna cafe, why can't we have a vending machine? That way, the jam hul
 doesn't  lose out on patronage, and we get better options for food. Start a
 new mail thread @concerned authority(es)

 Hey!

 The cafeteria will be something like the one in Jamuna. That is
 anyway going to come up.

 The choice is between Quadi Levelling and stuff like parallel bars
 and monkey bars.
 It is big problem for Schroeter Practice if the Quadi isn't a level
 surface and hence, the poll to decide which is these is more preferred.
 This will help the Warden know what the hostel wants.

 Thanks

 Hey!

 The quadi will relaid with new soil and it will be a level
 surface. This has been on the cards for very long and now we have budget to
 get this done.

 The outdoor gymnasium will consist of things like parallel bars,
 monkey bars, etc. These will be placed near the Basketball court.

 Thank you!

 Hey!
 Could you please explain what exactly are the two proposals, so
 that we can make a more informed decision?

 Thanks,

 Hello All!

 We have a specified amount of Alumni Budget this time. The Warden
 wants to use it for the cafeteria and for an outdoor gymnasium. If you
 people prefer to have the quadi relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium,
 please fill this form.

 We can, then, let the warden know that majority of the people
 want the quadi to be relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, if that's
 the case.

 I would be really glad if you could fill this
 <&thstrue
 form ASAP.

 Thank you.

 Kaushik,
 Sports Secretary
