@Nishanth
the cleaning of the dispenser is done using brush and soap oil(not just
with water and hands).The person who put the water cans cleans them.
@lazim
Dispenser near 316 is cleaned 15 days before also.Please let me know why
you people are not using that dispenser.If there is any problem it will be
resolved.

I have got a complaint on wings 265-274 and 201-232 that someone is opening
the cap of can and putting them out.Please dont do this.Put them back into
the box.
Tomorrow all the dispensers will be cleaned.


Thank you

Regards
Sowmith(HHS)
