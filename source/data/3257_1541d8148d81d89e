 Hi,

 Sorry guys, I don't intend to spam this thread but this is too much.

 As the hostel who has consistently placed in the top positions in all
 music competitions and with highly qualified members (Who don't need
 certificates to prove their credibility, since they're actually getting
 paid to pursue music), we sincerely apologize for helping Ganga win all
 sorts of competitions with our "poor skills in music". As a socalled
 musician yourself, I didn't expect that one could go so low and personal in
 some issue like this, which can be settled peacefully (Which we have tried,
 but to no avail, as you can see). We are being diplomatic and polite
 (Trying to respect someone older and more experienced than us) and you
 throw replies at us such as "Just to prove that my claim is not as hollow
 as your head I have sent one of my certificates to your personal mail. Now,
 you may suck that rat's posterior or frontal part as you prefer." Being
 someone senior to us, we expected someone more mature. But no, that isn't
 the case.

 Anyway, we'll stop playing our "terrible music" by Sunday, so you can
 peacefully study then or do whatever it is that you do. Hence, I request
 you to please stop spamming this group with more thinly veiled personal
 insults at someone you don't know and can't appreciate. Thank you so much
 for adjusting with us, it's really generous of you!

 I hope that this issue is settled now. You could talk to us personally
 (We'll be in the music room!) if we're again irritating you, and we'll try
 our best not to. Thanks!

 @rakesh vkr I see that your ability to read is worse than your skills in
 music. Rest your case and stop annoying people with your incessant
 practice.

 @arjunar grow up please. You're being a crying baby here.

 PS  you sent me a participation certificate in your school annual day.
 LOL.

 I rest my case. And am going to ignore any more replies on this thread
 and blissfully pretend you don't exist.

 +1 to Ravi. Even I never heard of such issues being raised.

 I have no connection into music but their's was pretty decent to hear.
 Their volume level was pretty reasonable and you can't ask them to play
 music like murmuring. If someone is very good at music, why can't you just
 participate in the hostel team? Or atleast guide them to play properly?
 Openly criticizing says that you have no feel for hostel at all, try
 encouraging man. You need not cheer all the way during their participation,
 atleast adjust for very few days.

 @Rakesh Vakr, All the hostels participate and hence practice. Hence
 changing hostel might not help him. Probably he should stay outside campus
 himself without any authorities involving.

 If Ganga is nothing to you more than a hostel, your certificates are
 nothing more than a paper.

 @arjunar Thanks for your opinion, but I assure you we do not give a
 rat's posterior end about it. We're pretty convinced the issue isn't with
 our music, par Kanpur mein kuch problem hai. I call bluff on your claims of
 you being a musician yourself, because a true musician wouldn't berate
 another's efforts. I maintain that you're either tonedeaf or that you are
 hallucinating the "music that sucks".
 The world does not revolve around you, and certainly, neither does
 Ganga hostel.

 This direct offensive assault on the quality of the Ganga music team
 is really depressing, as we want the hostel members to be one big united
 family (not that we are taking it one bit seriously). You really do not
 seem to fit in here. Instead of all of us going elsewhere, why don't you
 request for a change of hostel? That's a more feasible solution, and a
 winwin situation for us.

 Thanks, don't come again
