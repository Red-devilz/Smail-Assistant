Hi Naveen,

The printer facility at Ganga hostel (Visitors Room #116) is all set for
you guys to use.

*This is how it works:*

Just signup on *PutPeace.com <http://putpeace.com/>* on desktop or mobile
and go to "PutPrint" section to get printing done at your hostel itself.

The design of the website is intuitive and self explanatory for you guys to
get the job done seamlessly.

If anyone has any queries, they may contact us at team@putpeace.com or +91
916785657 or chat directly on the website.

Please inform your hostel Junta about this launch.

Regards,

Srinivas Naredla,

Class of 2012, IIT Madras,

Cofounder, PutPeace.com <http://putpeace.com/>
