Hi,

Sorry guys, I don't intend to spam this thread but this is too much.

As the hostel who has consistently placed in the top positions in all music
competitions and with highly qualified members (Who don't need certificates
to prove their credibility, since they're actually getting paid to pursue
music), we sincerely apologize for helping Ganga win all sorts of
competitions with our "poor skills in music". As a so-called musician
yourself, I didn't expect that one could go so low and personal in some
issue like this, which can be settled peacefully (Which we have tried, but
to no avail, as you can see). We are being diplomatic and polite (Trying to
respect someone older and more experienced than us) and you throw replies
at us such as "Just to prove that my claim is not as hollow as your head I
have sent one of my certificates to your personal mail. Now, you may suck
that rat's posterior or frontal part as you prefer." Being someone senior
to us, we expected someone more mature. But no, that isn't the case.

Anyway, we'll stop playing our "terrible music" by Sunday, so you can
peacefully study then or do whatever it is that you do. Hence, I request
you to please stop spamming this group with more thinly veiled personal
insults at someone you don't know and can't appreciate. Thank you so much
for adjusting with us, it's really generous of you!

I hope that this issue is settled now. You could talk to us personally
(We'll be in the music room!) if we're again irritating you, and we'll try
our best not to. Thanks!
