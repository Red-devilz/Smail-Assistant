 Dear Gangasters,
 Please read this mail carefully and give it some thought. I think it is
 about time we sort out the cycle parking issue. When I joined Ganga as a
 fresher, this was a nonissue. People seldom parked cycles in the No
 parking area. As years went by we had people parking cycles in the No
 Parking Area, causing a lot of inconvenience in removing cycles which are
 parked on the other side. But today we have people parking their cycles
 even in pathways that people use, specifically the way that we use to get
 our cycles to the Parallel Stand, that narrow way between the Perpendicular
 and Parallel stand. If the previous was Level 5 of disregard for people,
 this is Level 10.I don't think anybody can go worse than this. I mean
 should it even be said that one should not park their cycles in the way.
 This is ridiculous. I request all Gangasters to think about this so that we
 put an end to the painful routine we have to go through everytime we need
 to take or park our cycle.

 P.S: I found two cycles blocking my way to the parallel stand today. I
 chucked them out of the way. My apologies to the cycle owners. I don't do
 this always but I couldn't find a better way to inform you that your cycle
 is in a place where it shouldn't be.
