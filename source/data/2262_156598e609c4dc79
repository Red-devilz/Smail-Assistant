Avanti Fellows | Call for Mentors / Mentor Coordinators

Body:
Hello !

Greetings from Avanti Fellows.

Avanti Fellows is a mentorship programme to help low income students gain
admission to and study at the best universities in India. It was founded by
students/alumni from IIT Bombay and Harvard Business School. Watch this
 video to know more about the
idea and philosophy behind Avanti fellows.

This is an invitation to join as Avanti Mentors or as Mentor Coordinators
for the session of 20162017. Everyone who is a part of the IITM student
community can apply. We had exceptional results this year, summarized as
follows:

    23 out of 23 students qualified for JEE Advanced 2016.
    17 out of 23 students scored more than 85% marks in CBSE Board
   examinations 2015.
    8 students admitted into IITs with two joining IIT Madras

This is a mentorship cum teaching programme and the mentors will be
expected to go to Pondicherry to a Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV)
school once a month, interact with the students and teach them. Each
mentor will be allotted 2 students to take care of and the mentor must be
in regular touch with them through phone. We will be selecting around 25
mentors and 10 members as a part of the teaching/content generation team.

The selection of Mentors/Mentor Coordinators will be through interviews and
the selected Avanti Mentors will have to be responsible for providing
complete academic, moral and social support to the kids at the Avanti
Centers.

Join us if you really want to make a difference and transform the lives of
underprivileged kids.
