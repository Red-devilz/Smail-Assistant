 Hey please forward this to all students in smail.

 Hello friends,

 I am a M.tech. 2nd year computer science student residing in Room no.322,
 Pampa Hostel. My laptop and wallet are recently stolen on 11th October,
 2016 in morning between 9:00 and 11:00 am from my hostel room. It was a
 Dell Vostro black colored laptop. One unique identity of laptop was its
 broken lan port. Wallet was black in color. My laptop contained valuable
 data like marksheets, study material, project work and personal data. Also
 wallet contained important cards like College id, driving license etc.
 Money is secondary for me. Whoever stole keep money with you. Please
 whoever finds them help in getting them back. My intention is not to punish
 someone. Anyone can personally meet me and give my laptop back. I swear I
 won't take any negative action and identity of that person will remain
 confidential. Treat is assured. If that person is in need of money, I am
 ready to provide financial support.

 Hoping for a positive response from your end,

 Thanks and Regards

 Kapil Jain
