ABSTRACT :	=

	=

The possibility of employing both Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) and Kelvin-Helmholt=
z (K-H) mechanisms Three-dimensional sessile drops are ubiquitous in nature=
. We present the results of a new statistical approach to determining Conta=
ct Angle Hysteresis by studying the nature of the triple line. The local co=
ntact angle is calculated from the measured three phase contact line (tripl=
e line) of the sessile drop. Drops with randomly shaped triple lines but of=
 fixed volumes were deposited on a substrate and their triple line shapes w=
ere extracted by imaging. Using a solution developed by Prabhala et al. (La=
ngmuir, 2010), the complete three dimensional shape of the sessile drop was=
 generated. This shape was compared with the experimentally imaged shape as=
 validation. The local contact angle subtended by the sessile drop was then=
 calculated as the gradient of the drop surface. A distribution of the loca=
l contact angles for several such drops but of the same liquid-substrate pa=
irs is generated. This distribution is a result of several advancing and re=
ceding processes along the triple line. The contact angle distribution is u=
sed to yield an approximation of the Contact Angle Hysteresis associated wi=
th the substrate. Static measurements, therefore, are shown to be sufficien=
t to measure quasistatic contact angle hysteresis of a substrate.
