Hello everyone,

As part of IViL's Library Project, we are conducting a donation drive for
used books this weekend (*9th and 10th April*).

*A box will be placed at the security desk of every hostel from 9am to 8pm
on both days. Please neatly place your used books (in usable condition) in
the boxes.*

*You can also hand them over to NSS volunteers as part of the NSS
Collection Drive.*

Please find below a list of the categories of books we are looking for:

*2. English Grammar and Spoken English Resources*
*3. General Knowledge and current affairs*
*4. Logical Reasoning.*

*About the Library Project:* started by IViL last semester as a means of
bridging the knowledge gap between rural and urban areas in India. As part
of the project, we have identified a village in Veppampattu (Tiruvallur
district), where we would be setting up a library and supporting 2 other
resource centers already running in the village. Working with interested
young volunteers in the village, we have obtained permissions and a small
building from the village Panchayat to set up a library inside the village.

For queries, please mail IViL or contact me at 9790464091.


Warm regards,

Ajit Raghavendra
