Hi Rahul!

Thanks for your mail. I am quite impressed by the logical thinking and
speed of your group. Keep up the good work. Future assignments (the main
ones at least) will be more involved.

I guess there is some confusion. Are we talking about Meghana or Aparna?
Are they both same?

Hoping to have a good learning experience with both the groups.

Thanks.
Aman.
