ABSTRACT :

The current energy crisis resulting from global demand of fossil fuel energ=
y has forced humans to look for alternate sources of energy. The abundantly=
 available, sparesely distributed renewable nergy sources like solar energy=
, wind energy and others are failing to meet the global demand due to their=
 inefficiencies and economic viabilities. Hence of late, much attention has=
 been given to fuel cell technologies, which can meet the ever increasing e=
nergy needs. In our current study , initially 2D simulation of 180 degree b=
end is conducted to understand the physics involved in the serpentine bend.=
 The geometry is varied in order to observe any changes and when the inlet =
height is increased or the outlet height is increaed, there is formation of=
 vortices, which merge and collapse in the outlet branch and enhance the he=
at transfer. This study is then extended to 3D domain. In our study, we fou=
nd that the Dean's vortices are formed in the three-dimensional model in th=
e turn region and all the other flow characteristics are similar in nature =
to that of the 2D simulations.
