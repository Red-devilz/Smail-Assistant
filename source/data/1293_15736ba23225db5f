Clasfest - Carnatic vocal concert at CLT 6.30 pm

Body:
Dr Sumitra Vasudev performs today at CLT at 6.30 pm on the 2nd day of the
Clasfest, IITm Music Club with Akkarai Swarnalatha and Arun Prakash
accompanying on the violin and mridangam respectively.

Sumitra has behind her years of training under Smt. R. Vedavalli, and is an
unflinching exponent of that style marked by deep classicism and restrained
aesthetics.  Akkarai Swarnalatha and Arun Prakash are among the finest
exponents of their instruments and sensitive accompanists.

Please do make it to this concert this evening.
