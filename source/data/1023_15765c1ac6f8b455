 This is a survey to quantify the popular demand for more western toilets.

 There is a large demand for western toilets in our hostel from the
 crowd in the morning. However, in our hostel, there are only 2
 functional western toilets as compared to

 50+ Indian Toilets. 
 From this survey the hostel council wishes to understand how many more
 people want more western toilets in the hostel. Based on the demand we
 would reallocate part of the hostel resources for the same.


 Initial proposal is to introduce 1 more western toilet per floor. Please
 fill out the form
 
 to give your opinion.
