Subject:
EEA Talkathon on Engineering Problem Solving by Prof. Karmalkar

Body:
b'       Dear All,    Greetings from Electrical Engineering Association (EEA)  Please find the details of the first talkathon by EEA.     Title: Engineering Problem Solving   Speaker: Prof. S. Karmalkar, Department of Electrical Engineering    Time and Date :3pm,24th September, 2016 (Saturday)    Venue : Central Lecture Theatre (CLT)     Abstract: Students might wonder why their core curriculum contains subjects from diverse disciplines, e.g. why should an electrical engineer undergo courses in chemistry, material science, economics etc. This talk will illustrate with a simple example how the solution of a practical engineering problem requires application of interdisciplinary knowledge and multiple skills. It will provide insight into real life problem solving, and help students recognize the need for subjects from several disciplines in the core engineering curriculum.     Speaker Bio : Prof. Karmalkar received the B. Tech and accelerated PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from IITM, in 1983 and 1989, respectively. He has held visiting research / teaching assignments at University of California, Santa Barbara; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York; and University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA. He has authored numerous articles in journals, conferences and books, and has been awarded several patents in the areas of semiconductor device modeling and process development. For his research contributions, he received the 2005 Vikram Sarabhai Award and the 2007 IBM Faculty Award.      Deleep R.
