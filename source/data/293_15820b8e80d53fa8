Subject:
Gangasters Lost Digit Magazine

Body:
Hi guys,

I have subscribed Digit magazine for the hostel whose first subscription
was delivered 15 days back and someone has collected it on behalf of me
without my consent according to the delivery guy. I hope you would have
read the magazine by now :P

Kindly return the magazine to the security guard so that others can also
read it.


Regards
