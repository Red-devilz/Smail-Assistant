ABSTRACT :
	

Biosensors are becoming a part of everyday life, examples include blood glu
cose meters and pregnancy test kits. They detect molecules of interest (eg:
 glucose) in a given sample (eg: blood) with the help of specific biorecept
or molecules attached to the device. Biosensors are highly useful in the de
tection of several diseases like malaria, typhoid, dengue, myocardial infar
ction, HIVAIDS and etc. However, many diseases such as cancer and myocardi
al infarction can be diagnosed in early stages with development of highly s
ensitive biosensor technologies. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) b
ased sensing has been shown to have single molecule detection abilities. It
 involves use of enhanced electric field at the surface of gold or silver n
anostructures for enhancement of otherwise weak Raman scattering signals. C
onventional Raman scattering instrumentation involves bulky optical microsc
opic setup for sensitive measurement, which could be avoided by using optic
al fibers for optical excitation and collection. Further, gold nanostructur
es could be fabricated on the surface of the optical fiber itself to obtain
 compact handheld SERS active probes. In this study Ubent optical fiber SE
RS probes based biosensing is demonstrated for silica and polymer optical f
iber (POF) probes.

The specific contributions of this work include: (1) Plasma assisted surfac
e functionalization of POF using atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Di
scharge (DBD) plasma for obtaining gold nanoparticle coated (or plasmonic) 
POF probes. (2) Demonstration of SERS activity of the plasmonically active 
Ubent fiber probes as a passive substrate as well as an active optical wav
eguide for evanescent field excitation. (3) Evaluation of biosensing capabi
lity of the SERS active Ubent probes by realizing sandwich immunoassay on 
bare fiber probe through Raman reporter tagged gold nanoconjugates. An imp
roved detection sensitivity was demonstrated, by realizing the assay on pla
smonic probes (instead of bare probe) exploiting generation of hotspots bet
ween the plasmonic surface and gold nanoconjugates.


                                                                           
                      // ALL ARE WELCOME //
Thanks
