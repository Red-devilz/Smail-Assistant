ABSTRACT :

Spent nuclear liquid waste is often kept in partially filled storage tanks.=
 When such storage tanks are subjected to wind and/or earthquake induced ex=
citations, this could lead to detrimental safety issues. Therefore, storage=
 tank designers should ensure safe design margins and develop methodologies=
 to overcome a wide range of possible scenarios. In the present study, syst=
ematic numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the sloshing dy=
namics of liquid in a storage tank, subjected to seismic excitation. As a p=
recursor, the influence of resonant harmonic excitation on the free surface=
 displacement, pressure distribution, slosh forces etc. is investigated. To=
 suppress the free surface fluctuations and the associated slosh force, two=
 types of baffles viz., ring and vertical baffle are assessed.  Based on th=
e response to an imposed harmonic excitation, the vertical baffle plate in =
the middle of the tank, was found to be effective and its dimensions are sy=
stematically optimized. This baffle geometry was also tested for a well kno=
wn seismic excitation (El Centro earth quake).

Thanks
