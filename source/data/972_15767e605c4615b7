 Hi!

 The Academic Affairs SubCommittee of the Student Legislative Council has
 been deliberating for quite some time about the possibility of requesting
 Senate to allow students to redo courses to improve their grades. We have
 come up with a proposal (given below), but are having difficulties in one
 or two places with the main question being whether students would want
 something of this sort or not. Please do go through the rest of the mail 
if
 interested and help us out.

 Furthermore, please do fill this 
 form
 to let us know whether you are for or against this proposal before the m
idnight
 of the 26th of September!

 Proposal for Redoing Courses for improving grade

 Students who wish to redo a course in order to improve their grade may d
o
 so if the faculty teaching that course permit them to do so. The
 student must 

 a. Repeat the course and must have satisfactory attendance
 b. Not cross the upper limit placed on the number of credits that can be
 done in a sem
 c. Pay Rs 500 per credit to the academic section for redoing the course

 A student shall be allowed to redo a course only once, and the grade tha
t
 is obtained in the second attempt shall be the final grade of the student
.

 Furthermore, the grade obtained in the second attempt shall be shown
 separately in the academic transcript.

 Rationale of the points in the proposal

 While ideating, we realised that it might be unfair for a 5th year studen
t
 to sit in a 2nd year class. At the same time, we couldn't come up with an
y
 mechanism to resolve this satisfactorily, and hence we left it to the
 faculty's discretion. Help in sorting this out would be much
 appreciated.

 Rs 500 per credit is the amount one needs to pay for taking up an
 extracourse. Without this, we felt that there was nothing preventing
 students from generally trying to redo courses without being serious abou
t
 it.

 Number of attempts was limited so as to allow other students who might
 want to redo the course an opportunity.

 The grade obtained in the second attempt shall be the final grade  for
 better or for worse. Again, this was to ensure that only students who are
 serious redo course.

 Finally, the grade obtained in the second attempt shall be shown
 separately so that there is a difference between people who got have redo
ne
 a course and those who haven't.

 Thank you!

 Regards
 Venkataraman
