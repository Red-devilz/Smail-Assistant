K.Nanda      Date & Time: 22 nd  June (Wednesday), 3 PM    Venue: Physics Seminar Hall (# HSB209)      Abstract    Using density functional theory and climbing image nudged elastic band methods, we have investigated the electronic structure and electrochemical profile of pure and doped olivine phosphates LiM 1x  M  x PO 4 , M and M   being the 3d transition metal elements. We demonstrate that none of the conventional mechanisms such as MottHubbard, chargetransfer, and Slater are strictly applicable to explain the antiferromagnetic and insulating (AFI) ground state of these systems. Due the substantial symmetry lowering of the metaloxygen complex, thanks to the presence of PO 4  tetrahedra, the covalent hybridization is nearly absent. This leads the Bloch electrons to behave like atomically localized electron causing the AFI behaviour in the system. The compounds are classified as weekly coupled Mott insulator. Doped systems tend to have a lower band gap since the dopantd states always lie within the band gap of the pure compound. Analysing the electrochemical properties, in regard to LiFePO 4 , we find higher valence electron (HVE) dopants raise the open circuit voltage. The effect of dopants on Li +  ion diffusion is found to be site selective and short ranged. Dopants with lower valence electrons repeal the Li +  ion to facilitate its outward diffusion, whereas HVE dopants attract the Li +  ion for inward diffusion. Through interface engineering, we show that metallic ferromagnets can be constructed from these AFI phosphates.       All are welcome.
