Re: Gangasters Hostel Night Theme

Body:
Dude I think beach will not be a good idea. I thought about this and
seriously without girls there would be no fun in this kind of theme. And
its night, this theme will not appeal anyone or even the ambiance also will
be a pain and will not even be close to beach.
