Greetings from Social Entrepreneurship club!

The Social Entrepreneurship club was formed by like minded students who
share a great deal of passion for Social Entrepreneurship and see the need
to spread the message of social entrepreneurship to get others involved in
the field.

to draw upon business techniques and private sector approaches to find
solutions to social, cultural, or environmental problems.
