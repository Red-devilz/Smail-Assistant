<p><strong>Title : The changed way of leading and the lead to change</stron=
g></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract </strong>: &#8216;Change&#8217; is akin to leadership. =
While some leaders prefer to bring change in the existing environment with =
the traditional forms of leadership (the lead to change), others adhere to =
a non-traditional style to restore an environment,
 non-existent otherwise (the changed way to leading). The subtle difference=
 in these two forms of leadership has not been dealt with in the existing l=
iterature or in the book of management. The effort in this talk will be to =
shed light on these two forms of
 leadership with special reference to the changed way of leading in differe=
nt contexts, and to prevailing military environment, in particular.</p>
