Virtual Reality:-Virtual reality also known as computer-simulated reality,
is a computer technology that replicates an environment, real or imagined,
and simulates a user's physical presence and environment to allow for user
interaction. Virtual realities artificially create sensory experience,
which can include sight, touch, hearing, and smell.

designed world.
