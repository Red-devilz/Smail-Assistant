Call for Team Members - EDUHUBB

Body:
Hi all,
Greetings from team EDUHUBB, Centre for Innovation (CFI)

We are building a web/mobile learning platform which can supplement our
current academic curriculum and make it more accessible and fun. You can
think of it as a huge addon to moodle in a way that it has the basic
functionality of a course CMS
 but more
importantly, tools/services which enable you to access content from
anywhere, carry out discussions after the class, curate your own nano
courses to help your peers, live stream lectures and a lot more...

Progress:
Over the last couple of months, we have made significant progress and our
web and mobile(iOS/Android) platforms are ready with following features 


    Live/ondemand streaming of audio and video lectures
    Push notifications for faculty uploads, discussion etc
    Course CMS
    Nano course curator tool
    Discussions tab for each course, uploaded assignment, media etc
    Student uploads section for each course (where you can exchange notes)


All the features except the CMS will be free and we are planning to launch
them by the end of this year. We also received a lot of encouragement from
faculty members and are planning to do a dry run in insti next semester.
Sounds cool? Read on..
