Subject:
An Opportunity for students to learn and Earn Stipend

Body:
Hello All,



Pearson HigherEd Tutorial Testing are looking for students to evaluate
and test online engineering course material

Current Opportunity: Electrical Engineering (however interested students
from other branches are also encouraged to apply. These materials are to be
used by 2nd year engineering students from universities in the United
States.)

We are looking for student volunteers to test assignments and give us
their feedback on the assignments. Students with a strong academic
interest will find these tutorials to be a welcome challenge.

Eligibility: B.Tech (I Year, II Year); Other students are also encouraged
to apply for future assessments.

Finer details: 

Electrical Circuits: Maximum of 25 students needed. Each student will be
required to review all the assignments (approximately 35 assignments).
Stipend offered: 250 INR per assignment. Each assignment takes an
average of 20 minutes.

Important note: These assignments are for students who have a serious
interest in academics. As soon as you register, the reviewers here know
what is being done by every student on a realtime basis. Students who
attempt questions without sincerity will be disenrolled. Please pass this
information to all students who are interested.
