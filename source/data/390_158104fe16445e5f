I had a couple of questions regarding the assignment

1)During function calls, we are expected to save to s0s7 and t0t9
registers(appropriately in the callee or caller). Can we save all the
registers whenever a function call occurs or are we expected to save an
optimal subset of registers(like done in the public test cases)?

2)I executed this very simple piece of code using the miniRA interpreter
E
MAIN [0][0][0]
MOVE s0 1
MOVE s2 0
MOVE s1 BITOR s0 s2
PRINT s1
END
// Number of vars after packing D 0; Number of Spilled vars D 0I howeve
r
get the output of the above code to be 666.C2A0Shouldn't the output be 1
 for
the above code? The bitxor and the bitand commands also yield 666 when
executed like above. Am I understanding these operators incorrectly, or is
something incorrect with the above code? Thanks
