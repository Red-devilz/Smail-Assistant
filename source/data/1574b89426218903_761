Dear Sir,



Rolls-Royce and Pusan National University Technology Centre (PNU UTC) in
Thermal Management
<https://www.findaphd.com/common/clickCount.aspx?theid=3D1609&type=3D185&ur=
l=3Dhttp%3a%2f%2fptms.pusan.ac.kr%2f>,
based in Busan, South Korea is offering funded PhDs and MSc by Research
studentships to international/overseas applicants.



The need of achieving lowest fuel consumption and lowest environmental
impact in gas turbine applications will require a much more extensive use
of heat management technologies. The main purpose of the Rolls-Royce PNU
UTC is to develop these next-generation thermal management systems and
corresponding core technologies related to the aerospace, marine and energy
sectors. Having state-of-the-art purpose built facilities, the UTC offers a
world-class environment for the realisation of this goal.

The successful applicants will conduct research in the area of heat
transfer and fluid flow, mechanical integrity and manufacturing starting
before March 2017.
