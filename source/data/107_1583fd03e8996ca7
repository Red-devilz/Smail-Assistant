Subject:
Gangasters Lost 'Bed-sheets And Blue Bucket'

Body:
Dear friends,

I have lost a blue bucket with three bedsheets in it(two brown and one
orange)near the second floor washing machine close to room 363 on Saturday 5
th Nov. If some has taken them by mistake, please return them(secretly if
you wish) to room 402 or ping me.

I understand that the weather is cold these days and one might need some
warmth.If you are desperate I can arrange bedsheets from the NSS for you,
so kindly return the bedsheets and the bucket.

Ps: If you do decide to start using them, I suggest you google Jackson
Pollock first :P

Regards,
Jaideep S Saindane
