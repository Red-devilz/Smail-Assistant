The contemporary challenges facing a world with finite resources demands ho=
listic engineering solutions. In particular, the aerospace systems engineer=
ing approach, which focuses on the design, testing, and implementation of c=
omplex and durable engineering systems,
 has broad applications to these contemporary challenges in fields as diver=
se as health care delivery, infrastructure development, and energy producti=
on. Space exploration, where the field originated, demands systems engineer=
ing solutions at extremes of precision
 and reliability. Following two decades of relative neglect during the inst=
ant gratification of the &#8220;IT Boom,&#8221; space exploration has recen=
tly reclaimed its position as one of humanity&#8217;s foremost ambitions. T=
he landscape of current space exploration efforts,
 however, looks different than before &#8211; a growing number of private s=
pace efforts are collaborating and competing with public efforts in pursuit=
 of innovative, sustainable, and disruptive technologies that will change s=
pace flight as we know it. In this new
 and exciting era of spaceflight, Vanderbilt University has emerged as a ma=
jor player in student-lead aerospace systems engineering engagement, design=
, and innovation.&nbsp;This presentation will showcase award-winning novel =
aerospace projects of the Vanderbilt
 Aerospace Design Laboratory and emphasize the role of new systems engineer=
ing paradigms in engineering training and education for the 21<sup>st</sup>=
&nbsp;Century.<br>

<p>Amurtur Anilkumar is a Professor of the Practice of Aerospace and Mechan=
ical Engineering at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp;He has been a NASA investig=
ator and operations manager of microgravity fluid phenomena experiments con=
ducted on Space Shuttle flights and on
 the International Space Station. He is the founding director of the Vander=
bilt Aerospace Design Laboratory and faculty advisor to the Vanderbilt Stud=
ent Launch Team, which has won four back-to-back NASA university student la=
unch national titles and fifteen
 individual awards of excellence from NASA and equivalent number of awards =
from AIAA. Dr. Anilkumar was recently honored as the 2016 Faculty Advisor o=
f the Year, and the Abe Zarem Educator of the Year by the American Institut=
e of Aeronautics and Astronautics
 (AIAA). He has also received many other awards from NASA, AIAA, and Vander=
bilt University, including the School of Engineering Award for Excellence i=
n Teaching.&nbsp;Dr. Anilkumar graduated with a B.Tech. degree in Mechanica=
l Engineering from IIT Madras, and a
 MS and PhD in Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics from the Graduate Aer=
ospace Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
