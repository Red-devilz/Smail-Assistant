<p>Dear Sudheer,</p>
<p>Working with you was a great pleasure. &nbsp;Your sense of purpose, dedi=
cation, imagination,&nbsp;balanced&nbsp;viewpoints, and fine inter-personal=
 relationships with so many persons within and outside our Institute&nbsp;a=
re worthy of&nbsp;wider recognition.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Your persistent efforts to have the unparalleled sports facilities in ou=
r campus (the two new Squash courts, our Swimming Pool, the Manohar C. Wats=
a stadium, the Roller Skating rink, the Basketball court at OAT, etc.) comm=
issioned and maintained properly,
 or repaired and recovered effectively, deserve full praise.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I'm sure you would have been a perfect host during the inter-IIT meet pl=
anned to be organized in December 2015. &nbsp;The cyclone and floods then r=
obbed us of the opportunity to showcase our sports and games facilities to =
the various inter-IIT contingents that
 would have otherwise enjoyed our campus.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I must confess that i have often wondered how you maintained a near perf=
ect balance between your academic work, efforts, and accomplishments on the=
 one hand with the contributions you made as Advisor (Sports) to life in ou=
r Institute on the other,&nbsp;while&nbsp;contributing
 to a very cheerful family.&nbsp; Great work, Sudheer! <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Please accept my&nbsp;best wishes to you and all in your family for very=
 cheerful and healthy&nbsp;times ahead.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Of course, my best wishes are also meant for Professor Santosh, your suc=
cessor, who will certainly&nbsp;set&nbsp;new standards and benchmarks durin=
g his tenure as Advisor (Sports).<br>
</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Dear Colleagues, Students and Campus Residents,</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">After having an opportunity for 5 years to serve the=
 Institute in the capacity of Advisor (Sports), I have handed over the char=
ge of Advisor (Sports) to Prof. PN Santhosh (Physics&nbsp; Department).
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">At this moment, I would like express my deep sense o=
f gratitude for bestowing the trust upon me to serve the institute, and it =
was indeed a privilege.</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp; </p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I would also like to thank you all for the help, sup=
port, and patience you all have extended to the Gymkhana office over these =
years. The role of Advisor (Sports) has largely contributed in my professio=
nal and personal development, and
 has allowed me to make a sincere attempt to contribute substantially for t=
he improvement of the Institute Gymkhana and sports facilities. Such a cont=
ribution and improvement would not have been achieved without the support a=
nd timely guidance given by many
 of you. I would like to acknowledge the support from our outstanding admin=
istrators, faculty colleagues, staff, students, our alumni, and wonderful c=
ampus community. I would specially like to thank for the support from Insti=
tute Engineering unit and Gymkhana
 Staff members.</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Over these years, my association with Gymkhana has g=
iven me lot of good memories, which I will cherish for years to come.</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I truly believe that Prof. Santhosh is an excellent =
choice based on his experience and administrative expertise. I am confident=
 that he will take Institute Gymkhana to the next level of excellence. I re=
quest and hope he will also be extended
 full support and help from all of you, which I experienced during my tenur=
e. I wish him all the best.</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Thanks and regards,</p>
