Hello,

Greetings from *Raftar Formula Racing!*

We are the Formula Student Combustion team of IIT Madras representing the
institute at the prestigious Formula Student competitions. In simpler
words, we make our very own race cars from scratch and pit them against the
world. To know more about Formula Student, we suggest you to visit here
<http://formulastudent.imeche.org/formula-student/about-us> and strongly
recommend to watch this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGNPBTWrKOo>.

Over the last five years of our journey, we have pioneered innovation and
technical advancement among Indian teams. Through these years we have come
to realize that there is much more to a race car beyond its technical
aspects. Keeping up the momentum of our growth, we are evolving to compete
at a global level which has necessitated search for increased funding. This
is where *YOU* come in.

and sponsorship responsibilities. This role would involve the following:

   - Exploring new avenues for sponsorship

   - Content generation for marketing and social media

Not only this, depending upon your involvement we would be also willing to
include you in preparations for non-technical competition events such as
Business logic presentations.

Here's the value addition you can expect by being part of our team:

   - Opportunity to apply and refine your marketing and communication
   skills in a corporate scenario
   - In depth understanding of project management in a professional and
   demanding environment
