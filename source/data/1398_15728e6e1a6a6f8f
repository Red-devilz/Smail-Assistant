Design Club Session | 16-9-16, 8PM |CRC202

Hello all!

Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response and the valuable feedback you
have provided on the first event of the Design Club this year! Filled with
the motivation, we present you with our second event of this semester:



COLOR AND TYPOGRAPHY SESSION



What is it about?



Color: Colors are the interesting elements of graphic design
because they can be applied to any other element, changing it
dramatically. They can be used to make an image stand out, to show linked
text on a website, and to evoke emotion.



Typography: Typography is, quite simply, the art and technique of
arranging type. It's central to the work and skills of a designer and is
about much more than making the words legible. Your choice of typeface and
how you make it work with your layout, grid, colour scheme, design theme
and so on will make the difference between a good, bad and a great design.



About the event:

  We will explain the basic design principles related to color and the kind
of fonts that we use at different places.
  WeE2ll apply the concepts we have learnt by making a simple poster
 similar
to the ones you see on Saarang and Shaastra             pages.

No worries if you have missed the first session, we will be there to help
you.

Date: 16th September 2016 

Time: 8:00 PM onwards

Venue:  CRC 202
