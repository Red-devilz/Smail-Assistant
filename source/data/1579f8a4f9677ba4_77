Here is a great chance to interact with the Manager Engineering of one of
the prominent companies of our country. This is a platform to perceive what
exactly is going on in the Aerospace Industry. For the students who are
planning to attend the campus recruitment of Rolls Royce India pvt. ltd.,
this is an excellent opportunity to know the important areas Rolls Royce is
focussing. We can show our enthusiasm and passion by our participation in
huge numbers to create a positive impression on our batch. So I request
each and everyone to attend the lecture and get the benefit out of it.

Note: ALL ARE INVITED.

Thank you.
