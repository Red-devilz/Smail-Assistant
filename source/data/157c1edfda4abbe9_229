SAE Aero Design Competition

Greetings from Team Nimbus!

SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Aero Design Competition is the
largest collegiate Aero Design Competition in the world. A team of
enthusiastic individuals from Aerospace Engineering department and Aero
Club, IITM have registered for this event and are among the 75 teams who
will be competing in this at *Fort Worth, Texas* during 10-12th March 2017.

The competition features three classes, Micro,Regular and Advanced (details
of these classes can be found here
<https://www.saeaerodesign.com/content/2017_AERO_RULES_FINAL.pdf>) . We are
participating under *Advanced Class*, which requires the participants to
build an *U*nmanned *A*erial *V*ehicle powered by an *IC engine* with
remote take-off, payload dropping and landing capabilities. The plane
required for the competition will be designed and developed by us under the
guidance of professors of Aerospace Engineering Department. We are at the
completion of the first prototype and expect a test run by the end of this
October.


We are looking to expand our team in following *modules* :

Module

Work involved

Prerequisites

Structures

Design,simulation and fabrication of structural frame of UAV

SolidWorks and MATLAB

Aerodynamics

Simulations of flow around the aircraft in order to maximise efficiency

ANSYS and/or other fluid simulation softwares

Avionics, Data Acquisition and Image Processing

Onboard flight stabilisation and all the necessary electronics for
transmission of data from flight control board and onboard camera to a
ground station

Basic knowledge of control systems and flight control boards that are
usually used.

Python, OpenCV, Mission planner and Arduino, UI development.

Spons and PR

Being the face of entire team,you will be dealing with outreach,
sponsorships and interaction with SAE

Good interpersonal communication skills, Photo & Video editing skills

Eligibility

   -

   Undergrads above 1st year may apply.


   -

   The applicant must have prior experience for the profile they are
   applying for. Basic knowledge of the software concerned is sufficient. Y=
ou
   will be developing more skills as the work progresses.
   -

   Not to mention, a basic understanding of flight will always be helpful.

What=E2=80=99s in it for you?


   - By participating in such a large scale competition, you will not only
   develop the technical skills involved in building an UAV but also get th=
e
   much needed exposure to the practical world which is necessary to any
   engineer.
   - Software like ANSYS, MATLAB and SolidWorks are used extensively in
   almost all the industries these days. Hence, a good knowledge in them wi=
ll
   help you a lot down the line.
   - Needless to say, you might get a chance to represent IIT Madras at the
   largest Aero Design Competition in USA.

Interested students are requested to fill this form
