This is a classification problem. For classification problems, input data x
comes with a label. For binary classification problems the label is either
0 or 1. Your model also assigns to each data point a predicted_label which
is either 0 or 1. The 4 terms accuracy, precision, recall and Fmeasure are
all measures of how well the model prediction and ground truth agree with
each other. You can check the following wiki links to understand how to
calculate these measures.
