Dear All,

I guess most of you are hearing the word DCC for the first time. My
apologies for not getting in touch with you guys earlier. I am the
undergrad representative in our Department Consultative committee (DCC). In
short, we discuss various issues existing in academics, infrastructure and
try to get things working. This Thursday we are having a meeting. I want to
know if there are any issues that you would like me to discuss in the
meeting. You can also mail me your queries regarding internships or
courses. I'll be happy to help :). But do cc your group so that I don't
have to handle the same query again.

@first years, I have a fair understanding of your current curriculum and
about the new "Undergraduate research" courses that you could take in the
future. If you would like me to brief on it, do let me know.

Regards,
Santhoshini Velusamy
