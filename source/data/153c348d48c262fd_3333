<p>Students of the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology are without =
doubt, among the most intelligent in the country, if not in the world. What=
 will it take for IITians to realize their full potential, live life with j=
oy and leave a mark in the world?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two of our Alums from the 1994 Mechanical Engg. batch of I.I.T. Madras, =
Prashanth Vasu and Bharath Madhavan will share their journey since their I.=
I.T days, associated learnings and perspectives. This unique and interactiv=
e, lecture demonstration format
 is entitled HAIL (Heartfulness &#8211; Aspiration, Inspiration and Life) &=
#8211; What Really Matters?</p>
<p></p>
<p>They will explain through their personal experiences what training they =
have found truly valuable in their lives &#8211; Heartfulness, which is an =
approach to relaxing oneself, regulating the mind and purifying the heart. =
They would like to convey that by adopting
 such a simple practice in self-development, students as talented as IITian=
s have the opportunity to be not only successful but also fulfilled. They w=
ill provide a live experiential demonstration of Heartfulness.</p>
