Hello ,

Hope you are  having a great time after the quizzes.

Please keep yourselves free tomorrow evening at 6pm (4/4/16) sharp.



Wondering what the hell and why ?
.

I just love your questioning talent.


Get ready to test your intuition, reasoning, knowledge and interrogation
abilities as we challenge you with silly puns to exhaustive crime scenes.

Presenting LitSoc Cluedo, where you can showcase all those skills and
also get a chance at our very own flagship final round where you play
detective interrogating murder suspects.

No bars except for time limits.

All rules will be explained at the venue! No pre requisites but a curious
and questioning mind.  

So join us at CRC101 today evening at 6pm (4/4/16).

Teams of 2!

Awaiting your presence officer!

Coordinator Varun 8985318190
