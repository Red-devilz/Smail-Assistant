 Sir,
 
 I am Rahul Ramesh, currently a 3rd year Undergraduate from the 
 Computer Science department. I am interested in taking the course : 
 EE5154 :Complex Network Analysis offered in the even semester of 
 2017.  I would like to enquire if it would be possible for me to 
 take this course as a free elective. I would also like to enquire 
 regarding any required prerequisites for this course.
 
 Is it possible for me to meet you regarding the course? A preferred 
 time for me would be on Tuesday afternoon owing to classes but any 
 time as per your convenience should also do.
 Thank you for your time.
 
 
 Rahul Ramesh
