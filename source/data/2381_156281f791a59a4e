The excessively high rate of resource consumption by human beings is a source of constant concern and worry for environmental sustainability. It follows then that a lot of our environmental problems can be solved by managing and changing our current consumption behaviours. Having a psychometric measure of environmentally responsible consumption behaviour is thus very crucial. Such a psychometric measure may be useful in deciding who all are consuming in an environmentally responsible manner and who are not, who need/s to be targeted for behavioural modifications and who does not. Therefore, we propose to develop and validate a scale for measuring ones daytoday environmentally responsible consumption behaviours.                     '
