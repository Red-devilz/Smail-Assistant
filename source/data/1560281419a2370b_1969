Dear All,

Please find below the IITM E-Newsletter for the month June'16.

Thanks and Regards,
Media Cell

*IIT Madras has been ranked among the top 50 Institutions in the QS=20
University Rankings =E2=80=93 Asia 2016*

Sriram, Dean talks about IIT Madras featuring in the top-50 Asia=20
University Rankings <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DB4SD4Iv2S_k>

*IITMadras comes up with a game changer technology in electricity*
A quiet revolution in electrification is unfolding at Phalodi, a small=20
city in Rajasthan. A bunch of energetic engineers from IITMadras=20
have been lighting up homes using DC or Direct Current. The omnipresent=20
electrification standard in India is by using AC or Alternating Current.=20
A revolutionary new approach to supply electricity is being perfected=20
amid the sand dunes of Jodhpur district.

"This is not really a new invention but the world had abandoned using DC=20
power to electrify homes," says Prof. BhaskarRamamurthi, Director of=20
IIT, Madras. Today, the out-of-the box thinkers from IIT Madras are=20
reviving DC power as a potential solution to India's electricity woes.

The system is fairly straight forward but with key twist in the tail.=20
Houses that have no electric supply are provided with a simple one=20
square meter solar panel. The electricity generated by the panel is=20
stored in four regular lead acid batteries and the electrical appliances=20
instead of running on AC power run on DC power.

In most solar power solutions or in battery backed up systems=20
'inverters' have to be deployed that convert DC power to AC power so=20
that regular electrical appliances can be run.

In Phalodi, this off grid power solution is totally run on DC power.=20
This makes the whole system between 25-30 per cent more efficient and=20
brings down power consumption by almost 50 per cent.

*The slow and steady rise of Indian science and its positive impact on=20
the economy.*
In recent times, say some policy-makers, increased research investments=20
in certain sectors are also creating significant economic value through=20
startups. Nanoscience and technology provides one of the best examples.=20
The government began the Nano mission more than a decade ago, and has=20
invested more than Rs 1000 crore cumulatively. It is making its impact=20
on the economy too. A nanosicence student, S Anshup of IIT Madras,=20
founded a clean water startup along with his professor T Pradeep. This=20
startup, Innonano, attracted $18 million from NanoHoldings, a firm that=20
invests in material- science-based energy and water companies in=20
universities. "Translation potential is large in nanotech," says=20
Pradeep. "Investments can be small, the reach large and time scale short."

*A documentary on the arsenic water purifiers developed at IIT Madras*
This documentary is the latest in the series shot for the Thematic Unit=20
of Excellence on Water Technologies, headed by Prof. T. Pradeep, Dept.=20
of Chemistry, #IITMadras.

*IITMadras along with the University of Nebraska is working on a smart=20
Capsule!*
Researchers from IITMadras and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (UNL)=20
are working on an ingestible capsule that will stay put in the body -=20
potentially for close to a week - with sensors that will take readings=20
of an individual's calorie intake, eventually helping in diagnosis of=20
diseases such as cancer and allow for sustained delivery of drugs.

Dr.Benjamin Terry, Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and=20
Materials Engineering, UNL, Lincoln, USA delivered a talk on 8^th June=20
2016 on campus about a novel method and therapeutic device for Hypoxia=20
and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Prof. B.V.S.S.S. Prasad and=20
Prof. P.V. Manivannan from the Mechanical Engineering Department hosted=20
the event and spoke on developing the microcapsule in close=20
collaboration with UNL.

"The capsule, made of biocompatible materials, works like a parasite by=20
latching on to the intestinal wall," said Dr.Terry, whose team is=20
collaborating with IITMadras to take the device to the next step - to=20
measure calorie intake. On the other hand, Prof.Manivannan's team is=20
working on creating the system and controls for the capsule.

*IIT Madras students are looking upward! #SpaceExploration*
In an ambitious move, a few enterprising students of IIT Madras, who had=20
hands-on experience in designing and developing indigenous=20
Nano-satellite, which is in the final stage of integration and=20
validation, are mulling the idea of floating a start-up for space=20
exploratory missions. The students have stayed back after graduation and=20
invested several years, rejecting lucrative job offers to make=20
IIT-Madras Student Satellite project a reality. IITMSAT has on board=20
Space-based Proton and Electron Energy Detector, a payload that measures=20
the count rates of high-energy protons and electrons in the=20
upper-ionosphere to aid earthquake prediction. Now, these students are=20
sensing a market opportunity to begin a start-up having gained=20
considerable understanding of what it takes to make a satellite.

*Recognitions and grants*

IITMadras alumni Suresh Dhaniyala has received a Fulbright-Nehru grant=20
to study air quality and related health effects in India. His research=20
will focus on understanding the contribution of very small airborne=20
particles -- with diameters less than 100 nanometers -- to local air=20
quality in India and their associated health effects.

Sixteen Indian universities have made it to the top 200 institutions in=20
Asia in the rankings released by Times Higher Education this year. Eight=20
IITs made it to the top 100 list with IITBombay placed at 43^rd .=20
IITKharagpur at 51^st , IITDelhi at 60^th , IITMadras at 62^nd ,=20
IITRoorkee at 65^th  and IITGuwahati  at 80^th .Infact, IIT Madras moved=20
up by 16 positions this year. About 22 countries participated in the=20
ranking system this year, up from 14 last year.

IIT Madras was also named by Reader's Digest India as "Most Trusted=20
Brand 2016" in "Engineering & Medical Colleges" category and was=20
conferred =E2=80=98Gold Award=E2=80=99 by the magazine.
