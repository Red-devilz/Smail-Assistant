 The slogans they supposedly made
 "We will finish Afzal's job", "Destroy India", Called him a martyr, etc.

 That is a call for violence. If I tell you I am going to kill you and I
 mean it, would you do nothing until I actually make an attempt and then
 arrest me? One may be against judicial killing or capital punishment but
 that stand doesn't justify these slogans. In my opinion, there shouldn't be
 an absolute freedom of speech at all. Hate speeches do incite violence. If
 we were to allow hate speeches, we would see lot more communal violence
 than we see today. These are tools used by few for their vested interests.
 I am not against freedom of speech, I am only saying that there should be a
 limit. One can call for debates not violence.

 That said, I doubt if the organizers of the meet even made these slogans.
 It is established that the video showing Khanaiya Kumar was doctored. I
 read some random article that said ABVP members were involved in the
 sloganeering. The exact identity of the people who shouted these slogans is
 not yet established. I don't think the students of JNU will get so much
 support from within their campus if they did really shout these slogans. We
 don't know the reality. No media will tell us.

 ^Nope
 Quite a stretch to claim that destroying India doesn't involve violence.
 IF the video wasn't doctored, can't imagine defending incitement to
 violence as free speech. (I'm only making this limited point. Definitely
 don't support arbitrary arrests because of "antinational slogans")

 For the point regarding breaking of India. They might have meant that
 India, which was originally itself formed by forcing provinces to join the
 Indian state with army, is not a single entity and that as separate nation
 states, each region will have more autonomy. The problem with the "logical"
 video you shared is that it doesn't understand this line of argument and
 assumes that destroying India means killing people. No. The students never
 gave a call for armed attack on anyone.

 And the fact is, even in theory, I don't agree with the statements
 made.!!! I DON'T SUPPORT the statement made. But I'm merely supporting
 their right to make that statement. These should be argued out and if
 possible established that these are wrong, in an academic discussion.
 The more problematic thing is Khanaiya Kumar never raised these slogans.
 He has not made any such statements earlier as well. Some other students
 who participated in the event organised by DSU raised these. And Khanaiya
 Kumar was arrested for sedition.
 Please read the document I attached. Your doubts might be clarified.
 And I would be happy if you, a "potential" participant, understand the
 seriousness of the issue and the necessity to protect our democratic spaces
 to discuss, debate and dissent, and actually join the protest.

     I accept that you have your own view about the issue but what i
 think about it conflicts my perspective, I totally accept with ravi's
 argument. U being a potential participant can answer us a few questons
 1. The students of JNU addressed Afzal guru as martyr which he is not
 close to, he is the one who attacked parliament.
 2. Other than that students of JNU come with a slogan of destroying
 INDIA.
 3. All this seems like a big misuse pf freedom of speech.
            I ask you elaborate on these issues, because your discussion
 is only one side of the story.
 Check the initial arguments made by arnab goswami and also the
 statement given by protesters in the video
