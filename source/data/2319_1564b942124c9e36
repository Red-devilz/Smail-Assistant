Hello all,

HasnE2t it been a long time since you pursued an interest during you
r
leisure time for its own sake? The Leisure Time Activity Program (LTAP)
aims to enrich the personality of the students by giving opportunities to
learn various skills during their leisure time.


LTAP courses are designed for beginners and expect no prior knowledge in
the corresponding subject.  It is the best place for those of you who are
yet to discover your own interests and hobbies by getting an opportunity to
taste many.  After you identify your interest of calling, you can enhance
those skills in the various clubs in the Institute.

With professional instruction and classes outside the regular hours and
topics, ranging from Filmmaking, Terracotta crafts, and selfdefence art
Krav Maga, Meditation, Western Classical music, Bharatnatyam, Personality
Development, Spoken English, Web Programming, Android, Swimming, Tennis,
the courses are meant to provide a beyondcursory introduction.

More than 30 courses are on offer in 20162017. Starting this year, we will
also be having LTAP courses in Short Weekend/Extended weekend workshop
modes. A student can choose a maximum of 2 each semester.  The students
will also be given a certificate for satisfactory participation. Please
check out further details at the following link.



LTAP registrations for this semester are open. The courses will start from1
5th
Aug onwards. Please see details in TimeTable from the ikollege site.  New
courses have been added which include Krav Maga, Yogic Fitness, Chess,
COSIE etc in addition to the earlier courses.  Please make best use of the
opportunity."
