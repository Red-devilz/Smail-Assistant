Hi all,

Ihave uploaded notes for the Phase Space discussions in the lecture.
Please use this as the basis for your preparations.

Togetherwith problem/exercisesheets which will be shared subsequently,
the course content for this section will get defined. You will be evaluated
on this basis.

Iwould encourage you to look up further sources on the basis of this
material to enhance your learning and understanding.

Thankyou, Siva.
