Hello everyone,

Analytics club is planning to have summer school this summer from 20th of
June to 31th of July , 2016.

Sessions : 20th June to 2nd July
Projects : 4th July to 31st July

In summer school, you will be learning Basic regression, classification,
clustering algorithms etc. We will also take advance sessions where you
will be learning neural networks, text mining etc. We will be implementing
most of the algorithms in a programming language called as R
<(programming_language). We will also be
solving few problems and case studies which will help you to know how to
solve real life problems. The sessions will be taken from morning 9:00 am
to 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm everyday.

This will be a very good learning opportunities for all the beginners who
wants to explore the field of Analytics. These will mostly be the topics
which will be covered in the sessions by the club during the next academic
year. For those who are interested, you will be allocated a project and you
will be working in groups. This will help you understand how to implement
and compare various algorithms you have learnt. You can propose your own
project and work on it if you have a really good idea. You will be mentored
by a coordinator who will guide you to work on the project.

Your enthusiasm in the summer school and the projects will be considered
by us when we recommend students for projects, competitions and industrial
internship.
