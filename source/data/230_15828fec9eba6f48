Attention minstrels, vagabonds, o riders of this weary raft!

Turn up this Saturday at 6 pm to a venue that shall be announced to Writing
Club's second and last Litsoc event of the sem   a Writing Avial! Outside
of the Mallu band, avial is a dish that was apparently invented by Bheem to
not waste vegetables left over from the marriage of the Pandavas. Bunch of
stuff thrown into a pot to make a heady brewbroth.

So what you will find yourself doing is in teams of two attempt five fun
short writing events. Haiku, short fiction and paired writing funzies on
offer. Come off, turn up, arrivo scenarium, take fun and the ob Litsoc
points on a closely contested table!

Date: November 5, this Saturday
Time: 6:30 pm
Venue: TBA

Zainab and Achraj,
Writing Club Coordinators 201617
