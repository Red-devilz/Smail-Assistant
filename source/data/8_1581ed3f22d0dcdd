 Hi all,
 Greetings from team EDUHUBB, Centre for Innovation (CFI)

 We are building a web/mobile learning platform which can supplement our
 current academic curriculum and make it more accessible and fun. You can
 think of it as a huge addon to moodle in a way that it has the basic
 functionality of a course CMS
  but more
 importantly, tools/services which enable you to access content from
 anywhere, carry out discussions after the class, curate your own nano
 courses to help your peers, live stream lectures and a lot more...

 Progress:
 Over the last couple of months, we have made significant progress and our
 web and mobile(iOS/Android) platforms are ready with following features 


     Live/ondemand streaming of audio and video lectures
     Push notifications for faculty uploads, discussion etc
     Course CMS
     Nano course curator tool
     Discussions tab for each course, uploaded assignment, media etc
     Student uploads section for each course (where you can exchange
    notes)


 All the features except the CMS will be free and we are planning to launc
h
 them by the end of this year. We also received a lot of encouragement fro
m
 faculty members and are planning to do a dry run in insti next semester.
 Sounds cool? Read on..

 Want to join?
 Right now we are a small team (4 members) and are hoping to double that
 number. We are looking for people with the following skills (any one) :

     Frontend developer (BOOTSTRAP/ANGULARJS)
