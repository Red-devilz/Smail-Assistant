[Seminars] Talk on 2016 Nobel Prize: Topology Matters and the Dept.
 of Physics In-house Symposium 2016

Body:
b'     Dear all,     The Dept. of Physics will be holding its Inhouse Symposium on Friday 11th and Saturday 12th of November in CLT. The Symposium will be inaugurated at 2:45pm on Friday 11th and at 3pm there will be a talk by Prof. Ranjit Nanda (PH) on the 2016 Nobel Prize for Physics. The details of his talk are below the signature.    The remainder of the Symposium will be a mixture oftalks from faculty and research scholars about their work.    The programme is:     Friday11th November   2:45pm Inauguration   3:00pm Talk on the 2016 Nobel Prize for Physics (Prof. Nanda)   3:45pm Student presentations   4:30pm Coffee break  5:00pm Student presentations  6:15pm High tea followed by a cultural programme    Saturday 12th November  9:00am Prof. Satapathy  9:30am Prof. Khuntia  10:00am Student presentations  11:00am Coffee break  11:30am Prof. Rath  12:00pm Prof. Madhok  12:30pm Student presentations  1:30pm Lunch and poster session  4:00pm Prof. Mishra  4:30pm Student presentations    All are welcome,    Jim (on behalf of the organizers)     Title:Topology Matters  Prof. Ranjit Nanda  " the Nobel prize in physics goes to Thouless, Kosterlitz and Haldane for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter"    Abstract: The physics of phase transitions, that happen in the macroscopic world of our everyday life, is pretty well known to us. The most common to our eye is the solidliquidgas transition which one can simply observe by tweaking the pressure, volume and temperature. However, when we reduce the temperature to absolute zero, the thermal fluctuation ceases to exist and the carriers experience no resistance. As a consequence the electric current flows undiminished, the vortex in a superfluid spins uniformly forever. In this ultracold domain, quantum mechanically driven new exotic phases/phenomena appear in the mesoscopic world (films and wires). The quantum Hall effect is one such phenomenon. In this talk we will discuss how the contemporary physicists Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless in early 1970s and Haldane in early 1s used topology, a branch of mathematics, to explain these phases and their transitions. In the last part of the talk I will present recent phenomena like topological insulators, topological superconductors and topological metals.        '
