<div>SPEAKER: Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>AFFILIATION: IMSc</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>DAY, DATE AND TIME: Wednesday 30th of March at 5pm [Tea and snack at 4=
:45pm]</div>

</div>
<div>ABSTRACT: The study of active matter - matter which remains out of the=
rmodynamic equilibrium due to internal sources of entropy production - is a=
n exciting new area at the interface of the natural and engineering science=
s. On the one hand, it raises questions
 that go to the heart of non-equilibrium statistical physics while on the o=
ther, it promises new technology for manipulating matter at the micron-scal=
e with applications that extend to targeted drug delivery. Fluid flow is an=
 essential part of the physics of
 these systems and is a current focus area of research. I will provide an o=
verview of this area, present the key questions physicists have been asking=
, and outline some of the answers we have provided for these questions. I w=
ill discuss several recent experiments
 from groups &nbsp;across the world that support our findings. I will concl=
ude by presenting new designs for micron-scale colloidal motors that follow=
 naturally from our work.</div>

a scientist at The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai. His researc=
h focusses on two main areas, investigating the physics of materials and de=
signing algorithms that make machines
 mimic human intelligence. Ronojoy is the recipient of the Faculty Research=
 Award from Google Inc and the DAE-SRC Outstanding Investigator Award from =
the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.</span><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>He has been Hamied Visiting Lecturer at Cambridge University and Indo-=
US Science and Technology Fellow at Princeton University and New York Unive=
rsity. Ronojoy earned a doctorate in physics from the Indian Institute of S=
cience and then worked as a post-doctoral
 fellow at the University of Edinburgh.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Ronojoy's research has been covered in national and international medi=
a, including the BBC and Time Magazine. Ronojoy is deeply interested in Ind=
ian music and in his free time is either playing sarodes badly or taking th=
em apart to study their physics.<br>
