Subject:
Gangasters Regarding mosquito net for my room - 414

Body:
I believe this mail concerns the General Secretary of our hostel. It has
become very painful for me to sleep during the night due to the insane
number of mosquitoes swarming my room. I would be very thankful if a
mosquito net is fitted to the front window of my room soon.


Thank you.
