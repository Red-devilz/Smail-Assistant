Subject:
[Seminars] Discrete Math colloquium : Next Monday 3pm @ Madhava Hall

Body:
b'    Dear All,    Next talk in Discrete Math Seminar Series will be given by Prof K V Subrahmanyam from CMI.  He will talk about Invariant theory. Details are given below.   Speaker: Prof K V Subrahmanyam, Chennai Mathematical Institute.   Title: An introduction to Invariant theory.   Date, Time, Venue: 4/Apr/2016. Monday, 3:00pm to 4:00pm. Madhava Hall (HSB ).   Abstract: Invariant theory has been at the cornerstone of the development of algebraic geometry and representation theory in modern day mathematics. We will give a brief introduction to the subject, starting with fundamental questions posed by Hilbert in the beginning of the  20  t h m  span  onthe left and the right. Time permitting we will discuss the importance of invariant theory to the fundamental lower bound problems of Complexity theory in the Geometric Complexity Theory program of Ketan Mulmuley and Milind Sohoni. The talkisat colloquium level and accessible tostudents.   All are welcome  More details of upcoming talks at     narayanan      '
