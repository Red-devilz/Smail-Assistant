<font colorD"#000066"<bAbstract:</b</font<br<brGround Penetrating R
adar (GPR) is a type of NonDestructive Evaluation (NDE) method for identif
ication, detection, and location of subsurface features using EM techniques
. It is used for both civilian and military applications like pavement insp
ection, cracks, corrosion and/or leakages in buried pipes, and detection of
 antipersonnel mines. Commercially available GPR systems employ pulse mode
 of operation for detection and have limitations on the unambiguous range a
nd signal to noise ratio (SNR). Unlike pulse radar, Stepped Frequency Conti
nuous Wave (SFCW) radar operates in frequency domain and provides the flexi
bility to adjust the operating frequency points and signal power to suit th
e material and target under investigation. This work investigates the use o
f SFCW radar for detection of metallic and nonmetallic objects for monost
atic and bistatic antenna configurations.\r\nAn ultra wide band (UWB) slot
 spiral antenna w
 as
designed, optimized for efficient radiation (using reflection coefficients)
 and realized for SFCW radar operation over 600 MHz to 4000 MHz. The spiral
 antenna is circularly polarized with an overall dimension of 18 cm C3 
18 cm and has symmetric broadside radiation pattern. With the help of elect
romagnetic absorbers, the back radiation was suppressed as high as 20 dB at
 1 GHz. The Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) and the gain of the UWB antenna we
re measured as 80 degree and 1 dB at 1 GHz respectively. \r\nThe antenna wa
s used in PulseEcho (monostatic) and PitchCatch (bistatic) modes of ope
ration for SFCW demonstration for 5 dBm input power. The unambiguous targe
t detection range measured from the A scans was 18 cm in free space and 14 
cm inside the inhomogeneous sandbox in monostatic configuration with anten
na in the near field of the interrogating medium. The unambiguous target ra
nge in bistatic mode was found to be 700 cm in free space and 500 cm throu
gh the wall. The in
 fluence
of SFCW parameters such as frequency window, frequency step and intermediat
e frequency band width (IFBW) on target detection was studied by varying tr
ansmitreceive settings in a vector network analyzer. Experimental investig
ations demonstrate that SNR and target detection could be enhanced in SFCW 
radar by optimizing the control parameters to suit the medium and target pr
operty which is typically achieved with signal post processing in pulse rad
ar technique.    \r\n\r\nKey words: slot spiral, ultra wide band antenna, r
adar, SFWC.\r\n<br<br<br
