Hey All,


We have received requests from students and faculty about how students can
learn to solve the types of problems that we ask as part of the Google APAC
2017 University Test . For many,
they haven't had the exposure. To help, we are hosting an information
session tomorrow at 7pm. Requesting you to kindly circulate the below note
to your students.


Thanks much, Deepak Sridhar



What?

We are hosting an information session for students who havenE2t had 
the
experience (or opportunity) of working on the types of problems presented
in the Google APAC 2017 University Test. We will discuss the following:

   

   key data structures and algorithms
   

   a sample problem from a previous contest
   

   common mistakes that people make, and some practices to improve the
   performance
   

   Q&A focusing on problem solving, preparations, etc.


When? Thursday, 25th August, 2016, at 7pm IST.

Format: It will be a Hangoutonair. You can view at

Event page  

YouTube page  

Q&A: Questions can be asked via the Q&A app on the Event page. We encourage
you to post them beforehand, but you can ask your questions during the live
session as well.
