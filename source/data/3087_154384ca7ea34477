ABSTRACT :	


This study was aimed at developing a method for automatically selecting few
 representative frames from several hundreds of Axial Shear Strain Elastogr
am (ASSE) frames typically obtained during freehand compression elastograph
y of breast in vivo. This may also alleviate some interobserver variation 
that arises at least partly due to the differences in selection of represen
tative frames from a cineloop for evaluation and feature extraction. In ad
dition to correlation coefficient and frameaverage axial strain (FAAS) tha
t have been previously used as a quality indicator for axial strain elastog
rams (ASE), we incorporated the angle of compression that has unique effect
s on ASSE interpretation. These identified quality factors were computed fo
r every frame in the Elastographic cineloop. In order to avoid any random,
 isolated, frame that may happen to get selected due to its superior image 
quality, but does not provide visual continuity, the proposed 2step algori
thm identifies a section of contiguous frames in the cineloop that is comp
uted to be of good quality. In the first step, the algorithm identifies fiv
e nonoverlapping sections of N contiguous frames (ND10) form the cinelo
op that posses highest cumulative quality scores. In the next step, the sec
tion with highest cumulative contrasttonoise ratio (CNR) was selected as 
the final representative section. A total of 40 biopsyproven malignant or 
benign invivo breast data were part of this study. The performance of the 
automated algorithm was evaluated by comparing its selection against the on
es selected by the trained radiologists. To accomplish this, two radiologis
tobservers visually identified a representative frame after viewing entire
 elastographic cineloop. The observer identified frame that consisted of S
onogram, ASE, and ASSE was compared with the respective images in the frame
s of the algorithmidentified section using crosscorrelation as a similari
ty measure. It was observed that there was on an average 82%, 83% and 78% c
orrelation between corresponding Sonogram, ASE and ASSE of the observer se
lected and the algorithmselected frames, respectively. The results demonst
rate that automatic frame selection method described here may provide an ob
jective way to select a representative frame while saving time for a radiol
ogist. Furthermore, the frame quality metric described and used here can be
 displayed in realtime as a feedback to guide elastographic data acquisiti
on and for training purposes.
