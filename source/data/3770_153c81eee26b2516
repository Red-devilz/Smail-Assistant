b"     Dear Students,    You are invited to attend the  Prof. BR Sengupto Memorial Lecture  on  Apr 4, 2016 @ 5 pm in CLT , sponsored by our alumnus  Shri. Pukhraj Jain ( BTMT, '65 ) Dr Manas K Mandal, Director General  Life Sciences Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO)      Title : The changed way of leading and the lead to change  Abstract  : Change is akin to leadership. While some leaders prefer to bring change in the existing environment with the traditional forms of leadership (the lead to change), others adhere to a nontraditional style to restore an environment, nonexistent otherwise (the changed way to leading). The subtle difference in these two forms of leadership has not been dealt with in the existing literature or in the book of management. The effort in this talk will be to shed light on these two forms of leadership with special reference to the changed way of leading in different contexts, and to prevailing military environment, in particular.  </span  </span Dr. Manas K Mandal  is Distinguished Scientist and Director General  Life Sciences in DRDO HQ, New Delhi.
