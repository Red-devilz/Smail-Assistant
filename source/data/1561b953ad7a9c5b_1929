Dear friends,

Welcome to a new beginning and a new academic year with freshness in the ai=
r.  For most of you the break would have provided a period of connecting ba=
ck with your family, reflecting and regrouping to be ready for a new beginn=
ing.

I have been waiting for this long week to pass to see the familiar faces ag=
ain, ever fresh and full of energy. To connect with friends again is going =
to be a delight! Hope your summer went well with catching up on several fro=
nts!  The past few days have been unusually pleasant in Chennai, perhaps, a=
waiting your arrival :)

Your seniors were leaving the campus with a heavy heart after the convocati=
on - who will want to leave such a campus which has captured their joys and=
 dreams?

BTW, CCD (I'm sorry - CCD+ now) is back! Never have I seen Biryani and idli=
 available in a CCD!!!

Last academic year saw a lot of initiatives with a lot more flagship events=
 such as MUN, Saahitya, E-Summit, etc.  The coming year promises to scale g=
reater heights!  Your sportsperson friends are already here gearing up for =
a return to the throne.

While wishing you all the best, I also want to convey to you a message that=
 I feel is important and critical for your personal and professional growth=
.

We know that all of us are fortunate to be at IIT Madras and there are at l=
east a million young people who are envious of the position and the privile=
ge that we enjoy.  The question is: Should we waste this opportunity or sho=
uld we use our imagination and intelligence to create a world that everyone=
 will be grateful for and be proud of?

Once again, welcome to the world of learning and fun.

Anbudan,
Siva
(your DoSt)
