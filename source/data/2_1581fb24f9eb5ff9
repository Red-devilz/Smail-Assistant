Subject:
You can AVOID DENGUE from spreading. HERE IS HOW...

Body:
Dear All,
As you know, Dengue is a mosquito borne disease.
These mosquitoes are daytime feeders with its peak biting periods being
early in the morning and before dusk.  They bite multiple people during
each feeding period.

Very briefly, TWO IMPORTANT MEASURES:
1.  PROTECTING ourselves from the mosquito bites using REPELLANTS,
ELECTRONIC BATS AND MOSQUITO NETS.
2. identification and elimination of sources of breeding

Those TRAVELLING to other major cities in the near future, kindly take
SWINE FLU PREVENTIVE VACCINES.
