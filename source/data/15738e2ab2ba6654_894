Hi,

I am Rahul, and I had a couple of queries regarding the Compilers Lab 1 
evaluation. I had missed a single print statement in my final 
submission, due to which none of the programs that parsed, printed out 
correctly.
Is it possible to get it re-evaluated after changing the code? What 
would be a good time for the same since I believe, I am required to 
show you the changes in person. I'd prefer Monday maybe around 4:30 but 
any other time should be fine too.
Thanks.


Rahul Ramesh
