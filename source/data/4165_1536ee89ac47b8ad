[Seminars] Research seminar titled "Single Object Auctions With
	Externalities: A Tractable Model" on March 14

Body:
b'      Dr. Abdul Quadir from Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University, Japan will deliver a research talk on Mon March 14 at 3:30 pm in DoMS 110.     "Single Object Auctions With Externalities: A Tractable Model"    Abstract    We consider the single object auction model with allocative externalities in private valuation and quasilinear setting. We model externalities by assuming that every agent has a private valuation (for the object) and a strict ranking of other agents. The utility for an agent when another agent gets the object is the product of his own valuation and a real number that depends on the rank of this agent in his ranking. When the only private information is the valuation of the agents, we characterize the implementable allocation rules and, use it to derive the optimal auction. The optimal auction collects payments from agents who do not get the object.
