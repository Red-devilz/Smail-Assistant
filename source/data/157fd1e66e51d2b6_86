Dear Prof. Nagarajan,


I am from the London School of Economics and I am organizing the LSE SU
Alternative Investments Conference 2017, the world's largest conference on
Hedge Funds and Private Equity.

We are aware of the quality of students at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras (IITM) and we would be very grateful if you could
forward this invitation to your students. The 2017 AIC promises to provide
a dynamic forum for education and networking between leading luminaries
from the hedge fund and private equity industries and the brightest
students, from undergraduates to PhD candidates, who travel from as far as
China and California to attend the Conference. Further information and
application details can be found below and I have also attached a flyer for
the conference.

Kind regards,

Team AIC
