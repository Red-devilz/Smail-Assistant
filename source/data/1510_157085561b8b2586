Subject:
NSO Selection List

Body:
Dear first years,

The final NSO list will be circulated soon after NSO cricket selections are
over. Preferences will be collected before the list is finalized.

Please note that there is no issue in shifting from NCC/NSS to NSO after
the NSO results are out.

Thank you!
