Hello everyone!

With Sportsfest kicking off in style on Monday we thought it would be
better to capture these magical moments live. All those interested to join
us in this endeavor can do so by registering here
<https://goo.gl/forms/jWe8uJCHpMzhXMMm1> for our photo walk on Wednesday,
28th September. Special lenses for use will be at everyone's disposal and
the SOC media team will be there to help you learn what goes into a great
photo. Cameras will also be provided. Hope to see you there, to capture
Sportsfest's finest moments.

Best regards,
