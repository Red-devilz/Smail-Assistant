Subject:
Gangasters Lost chain

Body:
Hello all
I lost my chain either in hostel itself or the road from ganga to zaitoon.
It is golden coloured and it has yellow pendent (yellow stone) as well.
If anyone finds it please return it to me asap, it is important for me.
Please inform on 9176492137 or give me in room 149 if you find it.
Thank you
Shanttam Jain
