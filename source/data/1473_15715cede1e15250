Hi guys,
           We are conducting a survey on the most preferred product based
on Internet Of Things.We are going to develop an app based on your
responses and we hope it will address the following issues.



Please take some time to read and fill the form, it will help us a lot :) .

C2B7         WouldnE2t it be great if you are able to open your d
oor when you
are not around, and your friends /relatives suddenly come over?

C2B7         Most of us forget to switch off the fans and lights when we
 are
in a hurry, donE2t we?

C2B7         Imagine the difficulty we endure when we have to slog betwe
en
our Hostel room and washroom to check whether the washing machine is free.

C2B7         WonE2t it be cool if you get notified every time the
re is a
leakage from your water tank or if the water tap has been kept open for
a long time?

 Considering many of you face at least one of these problems (or any other
problem), which one would you in particular give more attention to?
