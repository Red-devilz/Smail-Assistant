<div>Dear All,</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Greetings from Electrical Engineering Association (EEA)</div>
<div><br>
Please find the details of the first talkathon by EEA.<strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;Engineering Problem Solving<br>
<br>
<div><strong>Speaker:</strong>&nbsp;Prof. S. Karmalkar, Department of Elect=
rical Engineering<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><strong>Time and Date</strong>:&nbsp;3pm,&nbsp;24th September, 2016 (S=
aturday)<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><strong>Venue</strong>: Central Lecture Theatre (CLT)<br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Students might wonder why their core curric=
ulum contains subjects from diverse disciplines, e.g. why should an electri=
cal engineer undergo courses in chemistry, material science, economics etc.=
 This talk will illustrate with a simple
 example how the solution of a practical engineering problem requires appli=
cation of interdisciplinary knowledge and multiple skills. It will provide =
insight into real life problem solving, and help students recognize the nee=
d for subjects from several disciplines
 in the core engineering curriculum.&nbsp;<br>

rated PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from IITM, in 1983 and 1989, re=
spectively. He has held visiting research /
 teaching assignments at University of California, Santa Barbara; Rensselae=
r Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York; and University of South Carolina, =
Columbia, USA. He has authored numerous articles in journals, conferences a=
nd books, and has been awarded several
 patents in the areas of semiconductor device modeling and process developm=
ent. For his research contributions, he received the 2005 Vikram Sarabhai A=
ward and the 2007 IBM Faculty Award.</span></font></div>
