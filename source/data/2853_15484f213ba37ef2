Thanks to Prof. Sudheer who has served as Advisor, Sports 

Body:
b'     Dear Friends,   Prof. Sudheer has just handed over charge as Advisor, Sports to Prof. Santhosh, P.N. (PH).   The past fiveyears, the Institute saw Prof. Sudheer at the helm of affairs so far as Gymkhana is concerned.      It is phenomenal to note that the institute won Gold successively for three years when he was Advisor, Sports.    He was responsible for a transformation that Gymkhana went through seen now through the number of students participating in sporting activities. &n;bsp;He has brought in a lot of reforms, one of the recent one being ready implemention offull accessibility of Gymkhana facilities to students. Students have to pay for membership only for Swimming now! Many facilities have been upgraded during his tenure.   We wish to thank him from the bottom of our hearts for the exemplary services rendered by Prof. Sudheer.  We wish him all success in all his future endeavors.   Through this email, I also welcome Prof. Santhosh, P.N. and wish him good luck. Being a Badminton player himself, I am very sure we will see sporting activities in the Institute scalingnewer heights.           Anbudan,  Siva (Sivakumar Srinivasan) Dean of Students (DoSt), IIT Madras. (+91 94440 08050) '
