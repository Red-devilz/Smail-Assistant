Dear Rahul,=20

=20	* It is okay if you save/restore all the registers during function call=
s.
 	* It seems that the current interpreter does not handle the bit-wise
operators. Since none of the testcases use them, kindly ignore the output
where bit-wise operators are concerned.

Thanks.
Warm regards,
Aman (TA - CS3300)
