Hey guys,
    With the winter vacation closing in and the Siemens interviews
stuck, the HRs have decided to withdraw their winter intern profiles and
offer summer interns for the same profiles. Hence I encourage all the
students who have previously applied for any profile of Siemens to apply
for the summer intern profiles now. Applications are welcome for Parallel
Computing and Data Analytics profiles as well all though interviews have
already been taken for those profiles. The offer still stands for the
candidates who have already been  selected for those two profiles but its
not a winter intern anymore, the offer is only for summer.
