The HHS already informed me few days back that he is going to get wider

 I believe this mail concerns the General Secretary of our hostel. It has
 become very painful for me to sleep during the night due to the insane
 number of mosquitoes swarming my room. I would be very thankful if a
 mosquito net is fitted to the front window of my room soon.


 Thank you.
