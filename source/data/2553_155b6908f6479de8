I am conducting a small user perception survey on pedestrian waiting time for my research work. I wish to circulate an email containing this survey links to all the faculties staff and students at all IITs and IIMs. Their responses will be beneficial for my research and further help us to develop better policies for safe pedestrian crossings in India.    I request you to kindly circulate the following information via email to all students, staff and faculty members in your institute. I assure you that no personal information is required for this survey. The data collected will be used only for this academic research work and kept strictly confidential.          Kindly circulate the following:   Dear Pedestrian,    Do you feel vulnerable and unsafe while crossing the roads? Please spend five minutes to help us develop better policies for pedestrian safety at crossing locations. Watch the embedded videos of pedestrians crossing the road and rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 with respect to the waiting time of pedestrians.    P.S: No personal information is required for this survey.    Please randomly click any one of the five links below and submit your response:     Set1:  cMYhxLz9yeQtKQY63  Set2:  0UbXDNPbW0XaFEcR2  Set3:  WM0j7Cpjf0WzfpVO2  Set4:  dtt5kTH4mfeFuDED2  Set5:  s722URwOUaBw79E72          Please circulate this email among your friends andcolleagues to help us get maximum number of responses.
