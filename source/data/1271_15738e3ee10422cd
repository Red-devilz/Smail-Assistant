Hi Rahul,

Yes, you can change a few lines of your code with some penalty. Monday 4.30
works for me, you can meet me in CV lab.

 Hi,

 I am Rahul, and I had a couple of queries regarding the Compilers Lab 1
 evaluation. I had missed a single print statement in my final submission,
 due to which none of the programs that parsed, printed out correctly.
 Is it possible to get it reevaluated after changing the code? What would
 be a good time for the same since I believe, I am required to show you the
 changes in person. I'd prefer Monday maybe around 4:30 but any other time
 should be fine too.
 Thanks.


 Rahul Ramesh
