Hello all
We are starting off with the magazines. As of now BBC TopGear India has
arrived (Nov 2016 edition) and is with the security desk. Submit your ID
card and take off the magazine. Return it as soon as possible so others get
a chance. Few more will be ordered and added in the upcoming days.
Link to the list

of
magazines.
For any queries contact me on +919176492137
PS Handle it with care!!

Regards
Shanttam Jain
