Hi there!

Music Club here.

We're back and we've got a treat for you! We're proud to present *Acoustic
Night*. Want to know more? Read on.

*Acoustic Night* is an acoustic open jamming event. Maybe you want to belt
out that powerful voice of yours that's only graced the bathroom walls all
this while? Or get a friend of yours to duet with you? And let's not leave
out the instrument players who can sing with their hands, shall we? As you
can see, the possibilities are endless(as long as it's all acoustic, mind
you). So come on over, and together let's have fun and give music a bigger
night than even the Grammies!There's plenty of enjoyment to go around, even
for those of you who don't feel inclined to sing or play music.

The Details:
When : Thursday, Oct 13, 9pm onwards
Where : Himalaya
Why : Because it'll be awesome!

Hope to see you there!

IITM Music Club

P.S. Don't forget to bring Odomos and lots of food.
