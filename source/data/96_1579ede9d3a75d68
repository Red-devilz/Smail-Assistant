 Hey All !

 Greetings from The Centre for Innovation 

 What's the one tool that all codingenthusiasts use, be it data analysts,
 web developers, hackers, or researchers in all fields varying from
 Biotechnology to Computer Vision  to Machine Learning have in common?

 You guessed it. Python.

 We at the Centre for Innovation feel it is absolutely necessary for
 everyone to know at least the basics of Python, no matter which branch you
 belong to and which club interests you. To meet that requirement, we are
 conducting an Introduction to Python session on the 6th of this
 month. The session is open to students of all years, not just freshers.

 Laptops, though not required, are recommended so that you can code along
 with us. We begin at 6:00pm sharp. If you have a laptop, make sure you
 have the latest version of Anaconda Python installed before you come (
 )

 Date, Time and Place: 6th of October, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm at ESB
