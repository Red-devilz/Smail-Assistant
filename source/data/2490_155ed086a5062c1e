Body:
b'     Dear friends,       The Indian Institute of Metals Chennai Chapter and  Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, IIT Madras    Invite you for a talk on   Novel Applications of Magnetic Nanomaterials     Raju V. Ramanujan  School of Materials Science and Engineering  Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798  & Adjunct Professor, Dept. of MME, IIT Madras      Date and Day:     15th July 2016 (Friday)</p Time:          &nb;sp;  3.00 PM  Venue:          &n;bsp; MSB 117  Tea:          &nbs;p;   2:45 PM    Abstract:  A brief overview of our recent work on magnetic nanomaterials for energy, biomedical, transduction and Labona chip applications will be presented. Our projects involve chemical and physical synthesis, advanced characterization and property evaluation of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and magnetpolymer composites for novel, cuttingedge applications such as energy, Bio, transduction and Labonachip.  (a)  Energy:  We have developed  low cost , high performance Fe and Mn based magnetocaloric materials, our recent results will be discussed.  (b)  Bio:  Our development of anticancer drug loaded magnet (core)  polymer (shell) nanoparticles (CNP) for multimodal, targeted and controlled release theranostic disease treatment will be elucidated; our CNP exhibit excellent drug targeting, hyperthermia and controlled drug release for cancer treatment.  (c)  Transduction:  Morphing was demonstrated in magnetpolymer composites; the actuation, damage sensing and multi cycle, remote, wireless selfhealing characteristics of these smart composites will be highlighted.  (c)  Labonachip:  Magnetic fluids have been developed for labonachip applications. The novelty of our work is the use of uniform magnetic fields  for tuning fluid flow.     About the Speaker:  Prof. R. V. Ramanujan is a Fellow of the American Society of Materials. He received his Ph.D. in Materials Science from Carnegie Mellon University. He earned his BTech from IIT Bombay. Ramanujan has served as Editor or Editorial Board member of  Nanomedicine ,  Materials Science   and Engineering B , Materials Science and   Engineering C  and  Metallurgical and Materials Transactions .
