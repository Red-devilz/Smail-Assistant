Hi guys,


I am Avisek Barla from team Micro Life Innovations. WeE2re a biotech
nology
start up focusing on making milk adulteration detection kit. Microfluidics
being our core technology, we make sensors in both paper and polymer. As
you might have come to know about the rampant milk adulteration in the
country and recent disclosure in parliament regarding the same. The
solution proposed there is no different to what is present in market. These
spectrophotometer based devices are expensive, resource hungry and
technically challenging. They can be installed only in factories, whereas
the need of the hour is for a device which can be used at the root directly
by farmers. This would ensure better payment for the farmers and also
segregation of milk according to quality.

We have developed such a device which is targeted towards customers and
would cost a few rupees. The project has won several prizes and awards
including one from Rashtrapati Bhavan. We believe to have only scratched
the surface of it as a number of patents and research papers are on its way
.

Here is your chance to add value to society with your knowledge while
building up your own knowledge, skills and resume. We are a team of 5
(including 4 PhDE2s) from various departments. Thus if you want to l
earn or
have expertise in any of the following fields, kindly contact us by 27th
March (Limited no. of people to be taken).

1) Basic chemical experiments in our chip (open for any person with basic
knowledge in 12th level chemistry)

2) Microfluidics

3) Optical detection systems

4) Image processing

5) Machine learning

6) Robotics & automation

7) Engineering Drawing /3D modelling

8) Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)
