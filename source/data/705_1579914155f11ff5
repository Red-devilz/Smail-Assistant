Shaastra Adventures || DELL Factory Visit

Body:
Freshers!

It's been almost 20 days since quiz 1 and you are back in your semester.
Are you missing the buzz of the Shaastra? Feeling that the semester is
getting stuck in a rut?

We think you need to get some of that fizz back and experience something
unique!

Shaastra Adventures is here! Your chance to experience something new that
you would never have had the chance to otherwise and experience the
application of theoretical knowledge in real life , that too for free.

A Laptop with boosted specs is all that you might want on a lazy weekend.
When you play CoD or DOTA2 with your buddies , have you ever given a
thought about how your laptop is designed and made by over 100,000 Dell
employees around the world? With a humongous task of supplying 140,000
laptops and desktops per day, Dell makes you feel their presence , be it in
Argentina or Brazil or your hostel.

Here's your chance to get special passes to visit the DELL factory in
Chennai. The visit is planned to show you the inner workings of the
manufacturing plant, help you understand how such a massive operation works
smoothly and you may end up learning some really cool things about the
world's favorite personal systems manufacturer, Dell
. 



So future engineers, this is your chance to get behind the scenes access
to an engineering marvel that touches lives daily. Fill in this FORM
