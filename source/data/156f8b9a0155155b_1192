Hi Vishwanath,

This is Satya Prateek (CS13B018). I am the Secretary of CS Club for the
year 2016-17.
I am writing this mail to elaborate on the function of CS Club and what I
plan to do as Secretary of the club.

There are 6 major events I am thinking of definitely conducting:
1. Freshie Nite
2. CS Cup
3. Farewell
4. Exebit
5. Ethnic Day
6. Department Trips

There are some other activities like T-shirts for every batch, Teacher's
day celebrations (if any) etc. which also come under the purview of the
club. I would also try to organize as many of such activities depending on
the feasibility.

Apart from this, I have the responsibility of cultivating enthusiasm for
extracurricular activities among the students of the department, inspiring
juniors and making sure that CS Club continues for the years to come.
