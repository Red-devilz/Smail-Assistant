Those of you who did not get evaluated in the slots we had indicated and
did not indicate the genuine reasons for the same via email (or do not plan
to show up for evaluations for some reason) will not be allocated any other
slots.

Ifyou want us to check your assignments, kindly send me an email at
ssahil08@gmail.com indicating your roll number name and language(s) used
for PA2.

Thanks
