 Yes. Dispensers are really dirty in second floor. But the fact is that if
 we close the door of the dispenser grill, monkeys cant even touch the
 dispensers.Also, some people directly take the water cans, fill their
 bottles and leave the cans open. So, HHS and GenSec, please take a note of
 this also and take necessary action

 That's the problem in Second floor dispenser too. The one near 316 is
 the common target for the monkeys.

 Hey! That's a common problem on the 3rd floor dispensers. I've even
 seen monkey poop at the flat portion of the water cans. Monkeys had figured
 out how to open those cans.  We can't really do anything here, I guess.
