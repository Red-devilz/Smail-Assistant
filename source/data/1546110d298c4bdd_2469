ABSTRACT :	=


The possibility of employing both Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) and Kelvin-Helmholt=
z (K-H) mechanisms parametric conditions, which is advantageous to interfac=
e distortion. In addition, this study also reveals that for a given energy,=
 the length scale associated with destabilization due to radial acceleratio=
n simultaneously as equal contributors to the primary destabilization proce=
ss is discussed. A linear stability analysis is performed to develop an und=
erstanding of a primary atomization under this combined action. Three-dimen=
sional disturbances are considered in order to predict the breakup structur=
e (ligaments) observed in  experiments. The fluids are assumed to be invisc=
id and incompressible. From the governing equations and the boundary condit=
ions, a dispersion relation is derived and analyzed for a single as well as=
 two interfaces. Four different regimes have been shown to be possible, bas=
ed on the most unstable axial and circumferential wavenumbers. They are (i)=
 Taylor mode, (ii) flute mode, (iii) sinuous mode and (iv) helical mode. In=
 order to represent the simultaneous action, a characteristic length scale =
is defined and it allows us to compare the deformation length scales in the=
 three regimes, viz. Taylor, flute and helical mode using a single length s=
cale measure. The dimensionless quantities relevant to this study are Bond =
number representing the ratio of radial acceleration force to the surface t=
ension force and Weber number representing the ratio of the aerodynamic for=
ce due to the relative velocity to the surface tension
force at each interface.

This study reveals that three-dimensional disturbances (helical modes) domi=
nate the system behavior under certain (R-T mechanism) is significantly mor=
e efficient than the traditional way of destabilizing an interface using ax=
ial relative velocity (K-H mechanism). =


In conclusion, the results of our study open up new avenues for designing a=
tomizers to destabilize a liquid sheet by radial motion instead of axial mo=
tion. In addition, the onset of transition from absolute instability to con=
vective instability, in the Bond number - Weber number space is also
identified.
