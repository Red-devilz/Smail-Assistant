Shaastra 2016 || Coordinator Certificate Distribution

Body:
Hello all,

The coordinator certificates for Shaastra 2016 will be distributed on 26th
September,2016 at Himalaya ground floor from 6pm to 9pm. All the
coordinators are requested to collect them during this time as they will
not be distributed again. For those who are not able to collect them on
that day, they can ask their friends to do so, provided they produce your
institute ID card at the PPM desk.

Whoever has not collected their Shaastra 2015 certificates can also collect
them during this time. Please make use of this opportunity.

PS An ID proof is necessary for procuring your certificates.
