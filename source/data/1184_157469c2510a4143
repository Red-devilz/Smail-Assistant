We will open a late submission link tonight at 11 59 pm. Every day of late
submission incurs a penalty of 10% on the marks you obtain. You can only
submit the assignment once (whenever you do). if you do submit multiple
times (before and/or after the deadline) the latest one will be considered
for grading and penalties will be calculated accordingly.C2A0

Partialsubmission is allowed in the sense that it is ok to solve 8 out o
f
10 questions or even to have a C2A0partial code for the 9th and/or 10th o
ne.
It is not allowed in the sense that you submit k questions today and 10k
as late submission (unless k is 10).
