Hi

Please follow the instructions given below for the assignment:

This is an individual assignment. It has two parts.

*Written part:*

Each student is required to choose a domain of his/her interest and write
down the specifications for building an information system for that domain
in plain English. These specifications should be translated into an E-R
diagram and a relational schema should be derived systematically from the
E-R diagram.  The specifications, ER diagram and the relational schema
should be neatly documented and submitted as a report. Deadline for the
written part: Oct. 28th.

Each student is assigned a TA as their point of contact. The students need
to discuss their specifications with the respective TAs during
November 1st week
and incorporate any changes called for.

*Demo part:*

Populate the relational database designed above with data and demonstrate
different features of SQL using queries written on your own. Deadline to
submit the queries: Nov. 11th. There will be a demo after the deadline.

Each student is also required to demonstrate programmatic access to the
database created by him/her through inserting new rows, deleting existing
rows and displaying the rows of any table. Deadline for demo for this part:
on or before Nov. 30th 2016.

Students can choose any RDBMS system and should use one of C/C++/Java for
programmatic access demo.
