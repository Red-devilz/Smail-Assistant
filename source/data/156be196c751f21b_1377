Title of the Talk:&nbsp; <strong>Enjoy, Learn and Contribute- - Leadership =
in Technology Stream</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The talk is based on the book titled &#8220;In Search of Technology-Experie=
nces of an IITian&#8221; written by the speaker and published in 2006.<br>
<br>
The progress of the civilization takes place when every generation first ga=
thers knowledge available to it through learning and then contributes its o=
wn to the world. For this, one must enjoy what one is doing. Otherwise, lea=
rning itself will turn out to a
 big burden and there will be no contribution thereafter.<br>
<br>
Learning starts from young age and continues through one&#8217;s career. On=
e can learn from various situations resulting in both successes and failure=
s. It is essential to have role model, but it need not be restricted to one=
 individual. The best of many persons
 under different situations may be absorbed to become a better person.<br>
<br>
Leadership is not restricted to line function alone. It is required in ever=
y field, including areas of technology and research. Ten top qualities of l=
eadership have been selected in this lecture. They are &#8220;Dream and Vis=
ion, Integrity, Communication, Innovation,
 Problem Solving, Motivation, Emotional maturity, Customer Focus, Risk Taki=
ng Initiatives and Constant Search for openings&#8221;<br>
<br>
The lecture will highlight the learnings and contributions from the real li=
fe situations covering the above areas experienced and enjoyed by the speak=
er in his 37 year professional career.<br>
<br>
