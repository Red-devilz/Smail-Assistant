Halloween Open Mic | 31-10-16 (Monday) 8PM | CLT

Body:
Hey guys,

Comedy Club's Halloween Edition Spooky Open Mic Extravaganza is here.

In a line, its a bunch of people acting funny in an attempt to make you
laugh while ensuring you get all the creepiness needed for a Halloween
evening.

That apart, there's a brilliant line up of speakers all set to be cracking
jokes for an hour and a half straight. Of course, we do not take
responsibility for burns to anyone present tomorrow.

For better Diwali puns than the one above, please do turn up on/at:

Date: Monday, 31st October(TOMORROW)
Time: 8:00 PM

Venue: CLT

Regards,
Team Comedy Club.

P.S. Feel free to turn up in your Halloween costumes. We'd all have
something to laugh about in case some of the performers bomb.

Final Diwali pun, promise.
