Dear Rahul,

	 It is okay if you save/restore all the registers during function call
s.
 	 It seems that the current interpreter does not handle the bitwise
operators. Since none of the testcases use them, kindly ignore the output
where bitwise operators are concerned.

Thanks.
Warm regards,
Aman (TA  CS3300)
