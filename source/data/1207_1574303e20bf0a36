Programming Assignment 1 Question 9
by MM12B045 NAIK ANKITA RAJARAM  Monday, 19 September 2016, 8:15 PM

1) What does "For every channel divide it into 32 bins" exact mean? Is it
dividing the 256 X 256 data frame ( i.e. for 1 channel) into 32 rectangles
and then finding the frequency of each rectangle?2) Can we use an inbuilt
package to carry out the L1regularized Logistic Regression or is it
necessary to use the code provided by Boyds Group
