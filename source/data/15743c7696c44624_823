Hello!

We shall have an intra hostel cricket tournament starting this weekend (if
the Rain Gods permit us).

Please form teams of 7/8 and register here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsAeOZPC1tBOei6p9llONlLtuqdahR3c3a315ivoMag/edit#gid=0>.
Choose a captain and mention it explicitly.

Each team shall play with 7 people with 1 substitute. It shall be held in
the Ganga quadi on a knockout basis. The matches shall be played with a
hard tennis ball. Each side shall bat for 6 overs. The semifinals and
finals shall be matches with 8 overs per side.

Thank you

Regards
Kaushik
