IIT Madras Quiz Club presents its first Quiz Club Meet this year, on *Wednesday
the 17th of August. *

The meet will be set by *Vishal Katariya*, and promises to be a fun,
accessible session. So if you're ready to get the dust off those brain
cells and put them to use, you know where to be.

Teams will be formed on the spot, and if you find yourself without a
partner or two, turn up anyway.

*Where?*
*CRC 101*

*When?*
*06:30 PM (17.08.2016)*
