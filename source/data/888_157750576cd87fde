Re: Survey on online mess registration

Body:
Dear all,

The survey results are as follows.

1)A total of 2773 responses were received which is about 30% of the entire
student community
2)90% of total students, 93% of boy students, 73% of girl students, 82% of
Tunga residents, 69% of Sharavathi+Sarayu+Sabarmathi residents told 'Yes'

Eventhough we didn't receive 50% of student responses, we had a discussion
with the administration about opening Himalaya for girls and Vindhya for
Boys. After a long discussion, it was finally decided to make registration
of messes in Himalaya available to girl students online.

From now onwards, girl students can register for all the messes online
except Cauvery. However, the limited vacancies available after allotting
boy students in Himalaya will only be given to girls. Hence, there are
chances that a girl student gets Vindhya even if her first options are
Himalaya messes.

We hope this will be a relief for many girl students, especially those
students residing in Tunga.

Thanks to Purab (SGS) for his support throughout.

 Dear all,

 Due to repeated requests from girl students to open messes in Himalaya
 during online mess registration for them, we have decided to take a survey
 from the entire students to know the opinion of majority of students.
 Please take a few minutes of your time to fill this form
 
 .

 Please note that we will only be able to discuss this with
 administration if we get responses from atleast 50% of the entire student
 community.

 The form will be closed by 11:59 PM, 6th September.
