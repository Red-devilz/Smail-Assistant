Hello all,



Greetings from *Entrepreneurship Cell* and *Centre **for Innovation* !



After spending sleepless nights during quizzes, it=E2=80=99s time that you =
finally
spend time tinkering on your startup ideas! The *SPROUTS* program formally
starts accepting =E2=80=9Cseeds=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Csprouts=E2=80=9D.



*What is SPROUTS?*



There are a lot of students in institute who have ideas for startups. A lot
of students who want to work on startups. But for doing that, there is a
huge jump which teams need to make to get incubated. They require the
product, the business model and a good team. We understand that it=E2=80=99=
s not
possible to take such a drastic jump by ourselves and hence, launched this
program to take students from idea-stage to startup stage.



SPROUTS will be an attempt for large scale harvesting of ideas from,
primarily, you, the students! This will primarily focus on maximizing the
suggestions on innovation by providing an easy platform to canalize all
ideas and streamline the aye/nay decision making process at each stage of
the idea into clearly defined time-lines.



*What we provide - *

1.     Milestone Based Seed level Funding Support of upto 2 lakh INR
2.     Topical Focused Mentorship from alumni and angel investors
3.     Professionally Facilitated Pre-incubation space at CFI
4.     Series of targeted workshops
5.     Platform to enable collaboration of like-minded innovation oriented
individuals
6.     and many other opportunities like one-to-one interaction with
investors and experts


You have the following two ways in which you could board SPROUTS =E2=80=93



*                       SEED OF AN IDEA*

*SPROUT*

One is a plain Seed of an idea.  This is a cue so that others may build
upon. Every idea coming into the SPROUTS database will be acknowledged.
This is the I-Seed stage.


Anyone suggesting an idea at this stage is not obliged to pursue it to the
next stage.


This is to encourage the sheer ideators, who may not have the enthusiasm to
work on an idea but who have the ability to generate a lot of ideas.


*However, all the suggestions here will be public to the entire Student
Body.  Anyone can choose to take this to the next stage.

Here, the team pursues the idea to make it a reality. They get constant
mentorship and support from various mentors.


They also get to network with multiple investors and get personalized
support from alumni to convert their idea into a reality.


In addition, teams also get need based seed funding, office space and
anything else that is required to make their idea a success.


This is suitable for people who want to work on their ideas throughout
their tenure at the institute and beyond.
