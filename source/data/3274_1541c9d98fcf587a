Hello everyone,
Some of you might be at crossroads unable to decide whether to apply for
higher studies or take up campus placements. Some of you might have already
decided that you want to pursue higher education.
In any case, we will be having a fundae session on apping and research
interns on Wednesday (20/4/16) at CS36, 6 pm. By students who
have successfully apped and have research interns.
