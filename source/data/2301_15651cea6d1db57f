 Students other than first years, please ignore this email.

 A warm welcome to all freshers!

 I hope to see all of you at the Sports Orientation to be held on Thursday,
 4th August in SAC (MiddleEarth) at 6 PM. We will have a brief
 presentation about sports at IITM, NSO and the Inter IIT Sports Meet. Our
 institute sport captains will also be there to answer any queries you might
 have.

 Do attend, as we will be having a giveaway where you stand a chance to
 win Inter IIT memorabilia. It has never been easier to get involved with
 sports; seize the moment!

 Thank you!
