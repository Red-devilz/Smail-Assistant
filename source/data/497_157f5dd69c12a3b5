get evaluated in at


I7ib_GWA/edit#gidD0


1. Please refer to what languages the TA corresponding to a slot is
comfortable in before filling in your slot. If your assignment is in
majorly in python, pick a TA who can read python.C2A0

2.Please try to pick slots which are close to slots which have already
been filled so that we can also finish evaluations asap.

3.People who do not have classes in morning slots, as much as possible
please try to fill morning slots. This is because the 5th sem BTechs
C2A0would have classes in the mornign slots.

4.Please show up 510 minutes before your slot starts. Do not be late. 
C2A0
