 Hello friends


 Greetings from Saathi!

 If there's one thing that we can all put down as a common experience from
 our days at school, it's definitely the exam week. With all those tips,
 strategies and success mantras doled out in abundance, you're probably
 already an expert when it comes to taking exams. Moreover, having taken t
he
 JEE just a few months ago, Quizzes at insti shouldn't seem terrifying, al
so
 because it doesn't have to be a terrifying experience.


 To give you an experience of taking a quiz before you actually take one i
n
 September, Saathi is hosting a Freshie Quiz 0, a simulation of a typical
 insti quiz.

 Familiarise yourself with a process that will soon become routine during
 your stay here in Insti. In any case, exams/quizzes are not the be all an
d
 end all of everything.

 We wish you all in advance, happy quiz week! Do your best, forget the res
t!


 Note: Quiz 0 is only a mock quiz. You will NOT be graded on this.

           Venue and time will be intimated to you shortly.



 Regards

 Saathi team
