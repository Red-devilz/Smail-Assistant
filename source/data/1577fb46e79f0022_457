Body:
We have been running into some issues with deployment of the new
firewall, and many of you have been reporting network access issues.
This is just a quick status update:

- We are currently experimenting with limiting the total bandwidth
occupied by YouTube and video streaming sites as they were choking the
network. First impressions is that things have improved for other
general browsing but become worse for video streaming.

- There are some individuals downloading huge amounts of data from
these video sites. Please stop doing this - you are causing problems
for everyone else. This is not regular video watching we are talking
about, but using downloaders. We would appreciate some support from
the students in this regard - please self-organize and help to improve
the overall experience.

- I want to once again remind everyone: downloading or distributing
pirated movies/songs is a criminal offence. We are required by law to
store logs of which machine on campus has accessed which IP address
outside. On demand from authorities, we will hand over this
information to them, at which point it is a criminal case outside IITs
purview. Do not let such a thing happen.

- In some specific cases, we are also receiving reports where even the
LAN connection is behaving poorly. Those are separate issues that we
are trying to isolate and fix.

Thank you for your understanding.
