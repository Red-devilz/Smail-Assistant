Dear All,

The following points were decided in the DCC meeting today.

1. A put peace printer will be soon installed in the department. If you
didn't know before, there is already a Xerox facility available in the CS
library.
2. And from now on, there will be regular personal meetings arranged with
the faculty advisors- roughly 2-3 times a semester, which will be
compulsory for all students to attend.
3. There are suggestions to introduce BTech only electives and to reduce
the number of lectures in a course to 3 per week. Another meeting will be
conducted to exclusively discuss this issue.
4. There is a discussion on whether to allow students who have already
taken ML for CV to take ML. If they don't, then ML for CV will be treated
as equal to ML and students will be allowed to take courses which require
ML as a prerequisite.
5. BTech students are NOT allowed to take the following courses - Advanced
data structures and algorithms, logic and combinatorics, Linear Algebra and
random processes, computer architecture

Regards,
Santhoshini
