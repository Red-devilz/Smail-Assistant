Re: Gangasters BUDGET

Body:
@Sportsec,
Please try to get water polo balls (at least 2) and water polo earcaps. Is
it possible to sponsor swimming card for Schroeter players so that we don't
need to wait for institute to provide us slots for practice.

 Please look into it if you missed the GBM by any chance and suggest
 changes.
 Have a good day!
