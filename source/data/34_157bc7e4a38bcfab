Hello all,

We have extended the deadline one last time to midnight, 14 October,
Friday. 760 responses have been collected and we are hoping to cross 800.
Please do fill and share. :)

As mentioned before, students of all genders can fill this, and you can
fill it whether or not you have faced gender based harassment. It won't
take much of your time. Thank you!

Warm regards,

 Hello all,

 This is a final reminder for this survey. We have extended the deadline to
 midnight, 12 October (Wednesday). 600 responses have been received as
 of now.

 The results will also be used by the SLC Committee working on forming
 guidelines for CCASH, the formal body dealing with these issues, so it
 would be very valuable to get all your inputs.

 To reiterate: students of all genders can fill this, and you can fill it
 whether or not you have faced gender based harassment. Filling it will not
 take much of your time. Please do share with your friends.

 Warm regards,
 The T5E Team

 Dear All,

 T5E releases a new student survey
 : this one on gender based
 harassment in the institute.

 The objective of the survey is to draw a clearer picture of the state of
 affairs when it comes to gender related harassment in campus. However
 please note that this is not a comprehensive survey, nor is it
 restricted to any particular gender. Also note that the survey is
 strictly anonymous.

 Reliability of the data we collect depends partly on ensuring a large
 number of responses. Please take a few minutes to fill this survey and
 share it with your friends irrespective of your experiences and
 opinions on this issue. The survey responses will be made available on the
 website shortly.

 Warm regards,
