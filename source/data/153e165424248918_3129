Hello all
   You can see the responses for menu poll in HOSTEL NIGHT MENU POLL
<https://docs.google.com/a/smail.iitm.ac.in/forms/d/1C-obsHm0hMMSC3qYsc_YH5E1Fnv8ktGiOZ70LDg_xhc/viewform>
Menu will be decided totally based on the poll taken unless if there is any
issue with caterers in the last minute.

There are 3 starters for veg people which is mentioned as only two earlier.

cheers
