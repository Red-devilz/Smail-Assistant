Re: Shaastra 2017 || Born to Wander

Hello again guys,

We'd bring forth some essential guidelines & subtle reminders for the
Shaastra event Born to Wander.

Following are points to be considered:

   1. Participants coming to Himalaya at 6:00pm, that is at the start of
   event will have an approx. 20 minutes advantage over those who begin it on
   social media.
   2. Social Media for above said is decided as Facebook & question will be
   posted on Shaastra's official Facebook page.
   3. Teams will consist of 2 members.
   4. Carry pens and mobile phones for your convenience.
   5. Take a close look at the spiral in the poster and do what you need to
   do to get an advantage over other teams ;)

Hope to see all of you there @Himalaya!

Regards,
Team Shaastra 2017
