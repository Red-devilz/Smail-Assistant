Dear Students,

There was some inconsistency between the internship requirements sent to
2013 and 2014 batches.
To address this, HoD has suggested to update the requirements sent to you,
to the following.
Please read below.


Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Indian Institute of Technology Madras

For the internship done in a company located in India until July 2016 (or
Jul 2017), the following documents must be submitted by Aug. 16, 2016 (2017
resp.):
1. Offer letter from the company before the internship was accepted. Please
inform the company and your mentor/supervisor about assessment requirement.
2. Internship Successful Completion Certificate, or equivalent, issued by
the company.
3. A detailed technical report in hardcopy (length: at least 4 pages,
singlecolumn, singlespaced, 1inch margins on all sides) explaining the
technical specifics of the tasks done; language/tools/environment of
development/ to what extent the work involved the use of computer science
skills (e.g. data structures, algorithms, other concepts); what the student
learned from the internship; and a rationale as to why this internship
should be accepted as the equivalent of a thirdyear level internship.
Include your name and roll number in the report.
PLEASE get the company's approval of the report to ensure that any company
confidential information is not included in the report.

 Hastily/poorly written documents that have grammar/spelling mistakes and
those without much technical content will NOT be considered.
 The grade assigned will be based on the relevance of the internship to
CSE and the student's report quality.


Best regards,
Jayalal

 Dear Students,

 Many of you might have been doing internship in the industry over this
 summer and might be planning to credit it to meet the curriculum
 requirements in the 3rd year summer (2 credit course under the PIT category
 with P/F grade). Please find attached the guidelines from the department
 regarding the same.

 We assume that, in case of a doubt, you must have discussed with your
 faculty advisor about whether the work assigned in the internship suits to
 be credited as "PIT" credits in the CSE curriculum. The guideline mostly
 describes the steps you need to take towards the end of the internship that
 you intend to credit.

 Feel free to get back to us if you have any questions.

 Best regards,
 Jayalal
