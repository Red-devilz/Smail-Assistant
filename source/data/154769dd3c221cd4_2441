Hello All!

We have a specified amount of Alumni Budget this time. The Warden wants to
use it for the cafeteria and for an outdoor gymnasium. If you people prefer
to have the quadi re-laid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, please fill
this form.

We can, then, let the warden know that majority of the people want the
quadi to be re-laid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, if that's the case.

I would be really glad if you could fill this
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XSTrgD5-vqJpdAtSDQfBCPXxcpcl875FAASli0haTMU/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true>
form ASAP.

Thank you.

Kaushik,
Sports Secretary
