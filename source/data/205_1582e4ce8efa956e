Fret not, for Quarter Ticket is here to make sure this doesn't end up being
yet another gloomy weekend!

own Insti junta put up not less than three varied short plays, promising to
be a refresher, and much more! Featuring

While the auto waits  What happens when people lie about who they are?
A cute meet with an ironic twist!Pratibimb (Reflections)  When your
inner conscience dies, what do you do? And what does it do to you? Sure
thing  Our take on the classic boymeetsgirlinabar story, will this
chance meeting result in a happy ending?

Venue: CLT

Date: 5th November, Saturday

Time: 10:30 A.M 

See you there!

Cheers,
