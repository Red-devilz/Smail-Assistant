    *Hon=E2=80=99ble Minister Sh. Piyush Goyal inaugurates Green Technology
    innovations by IIT Madras*
    Minister of State with Independent Charge for Power, Coal, New and
    Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Mines, Govt. of India, Sh. Piyush Goyal,
    visited the IIT Madras campus and Research Park on 15 July 2016. He
    formally inaugurated the innovative solar-DC products INVERTERLESS
    and appliances, developed by IITM and its incubated renewable energy
    companies, and the Green Building cooling system along with the
    Insulated Thermal Storage tank at the Research Park, as well as
    laid the foundation stone for the Centre for Battery Engineering and
    Electric Vehicles.

    Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT Madras welcomed the Minister
    and presented the vision for IITM Research Park. Prof. Ashok
    Jhunjhunwala, Co-chairman and Faculty-in-Charge of IIT Madras
    Incubation Cell, accompanied the Minister on his tour of Research
    Park and showed him an exhibit of the Green Office and Green Home
    - the power of a single 125W solar panel and how it powers a whole
    home with DC appliances.

    Inaugurating of the Green Technology innovations at IIT Madras,
    Sh.Goyal said, "Today's showcase of innovative green technology
    research at IIT Madras highlights a new kind of partnership made
    possible by IIT Madras between Public-Private-Professor-People
    (PPPP). These technologies can make uninterrupted power accessible
    and affordable for the poor and aligns with the Government's
    commitment to make power available to every home in India.  These
    technologies are a significant leap towards India achieving energy
    security goals."

    *53^rd Convocation held at IIT Madras*

    IIT Madras celebrated its 53rd Convocation on 22nd July 2016 on
    Campus. Dr. Jayant Baliga, Distinguished University Professor, North
    Carolina State University, Raleigh NC, USA, was the Chief Guest for
    the function and was felicitated with the Degree of Doctor of
    Science (HonorisCausa), on the occasion. Dr. Pawan Goenka, Chairman,
    Board of Governors, IIT Madras and Executive Director, Mahindra &
    Mahindra, presided over the function.

    The Chief Guest presented prizes to the
    students. Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT Madras awarded
    degrees to the graduating students. Degrees for two new courses were
    awarded for the first time at this year=E2=80=99s Convocation, M.S. and
    Ph.D. (Dual Degree) and Postgraduate Diploma in Visionary Leadership
    in Manufacturing (PGDVLM).  A total of 2191 degrees were awarded
    this year.

    *AlumNite 2016 in all its glory!*
    IIT Madras celebrated its second AlumNite, a variant of the
    traditional alumni day, on 23rd July 2016.

    DrJayantBaligaDistinguised University Professor and Director, Power
    Semiconductor Research Center, North Carolina State University, was
    conferred Distinguished Alumnus Award 2016 on the occasion.

    The other recipient of the Alumnus awards were Dr. S. Christopher,
    Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Director General, DRDO and
    Dr. AravindSrinivasan Professor, Department of Computer Science and
    Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland.

    A recently established alumni chair, named after Mr. V Balaraman,
    former Managing Director of Ponds, was established in April was
    officially launched during the event.

    *IIT-Madras topper bags Visvesvaraya memorial prize en route to
    Stanford for higher studies*
    Joseph Samuel, who got B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering and became
    a topper in IIT-Madras, won the Bharat Ratna M Visvesvaraya memorial
    prize. He is interested in researching on wireless communication. He
    said this during the 53rd convocation ceremony of IIT Madras held on
    22 July 2016.

    He got 9.96 CGPA and said he would pursue Ph D in wireless
    communication from Stanford University. =E2=80=9CIn Stanford University=
 I am
    directly getting into integrated program MS- PhD,=E2=80=9D he said, add=
ing
    that he had done two projects in IIT related to wireless
    communication. =E2=80=9CI did a project on full duplex. Normally all
    communication systems such as cell phones, WiFi device transmit and
    receive two different frequencies,=E2=80=9D he said. Citing example, he=
 said
    that the signal which goes from the 2G phone to the power is one
    frequency bandwidth and again from the tower to the phone is another
    frequency bandwidth. That is wastage of bandwidth; so I am trying to
    do both in a single frequency bandwidth. I did another project on
    satellite,=E2=80=9D Samuel said. He has also received Siemens Prize.

    *IIT-M grads cheer loud for IITMSAT*

    <http://alumni.iitm.ac.in/alumni_day_registration/>

    The 53rd convocation at IIT-Madras was, understandably, marked by
    cheers but, the loudest and the most earnest were reserved for
    Director, Prof.BhaskarRamamurthi's announcement that IITMSAT was all
    set for launch (by ISRO) in October this year.

    The student-led satellite initiative was started in 2011 and it will
    be up for final tests, the Director said while reading out the
    Director`s Report.

    *IIT Madras is powering India through the Sun! *

    IIT-Madras students recently installed 1.5 kW solar panels with
    energy efficient DC (direct current) technology in Government Girls
    Higher Secondary School at Ashok Nagar here in Chennai.

    Prof. Srikanth Vedantam, Head, Department of Engineering Design, IIT
    Madras inaugurated the plant which covers 12 classrooms in the
    block. Students who were part of an NGO, Engineers Without Borders
    (EWB),  set up the plant.

    =E2=80=9CThe lights and fans in the block were replaced with specially
    designed DC lights and fans which consume only half of the power
    compared to AC (alternating current) appliances=E2=80=9D, said K.Venkat=
esh,
    a fourth-year student in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering
    Department of the Institute.

    =E2=80=9CThe LED fluorescent lights consume 18 watts at full brightness=
,
    unlike conventional fluorescent lights that consume 36 watts. The DC
    fan consumes only 30 watts at maximum speed whereas the conventional
    fans consume 80 watts at full power,=E2=80=9D he said.

    With the DC based equipment (solar panels, battery and lights, fans)
    in place, conversion losses are avoided. As a result, solar panels
    providing 1.5 kW power is sufficient to power lights and fans in the
    block, which would have otherwise required solar panels to generate
    six to eight kW power if conventional AC-based technologies had been
    used.

    *#IITMadras Alumni come up with innovative solutions to everyday
    problems!*
    A four-month-old IIT-Madras incubated start-up, Detect Technologies
    (DeTect), is already taking giant leaps at both domestic and
    international arena. Its product, the Guided Ultrasonic Monitoring
    of Pipe Systems (Gumps) is being viewed as world=E2=80=99s first high
    temperature monitoring system based on sensors that will tolerate
    heat up to 350 degree Celsius and detect leakages in
    pipelines besides actually telling the rate of corrosion.

    Another innovation is the facility to dispose off sanitary pads.
    Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), an organization of Indian Railways
    that does engineering work, has installed an electronic sanitary
    napkin vending machine and a destroyer at the station.

    Developed by an IIT-Madras alumnus, the sanitary napkin incinerator
    can burn soiled pads in to ashes within few minutes. The waste can
    either be used as a manure for plants or can be flushed out.

    Setup along with information boards, the idea was also to break the
    taboo and raise awareness on menstrual health. The machines have
    been installed along with token and coin vending machines as part of
    CSR activity of RVNL.
