The progress of the civilization takes place when every generation first gathers knowledge available to it through learning and then contributes its own to the world. For this, one must enjoy what one is doing. Otherwise, learning itself will turn out to a big burden and there will be no contribution thereafter.  Learning starts from young age and continues through ones career. One can learn from various situations resulting in both successes and failures. It is essential to have role model, but it need not be restricted to one individual. The best of many persons under different situations may be absorbed to become a better person.  Leadership is not restricted to line function alone. It is required in every field, including areas of technology and research. Ten top qualities of leadership have been selected in this lecture. They are Dream and Vision, Integrity, Communication, Innovation, Problem Solving, Motivation, Emotional maturity, Customer Focus, Risk Taking Initiatives and Constant Search for openings  The lecture will highlight the learnings and contributions from the real life situations covering the above areas experienced and enjoyed by the speaker in his 37 year professional career.
