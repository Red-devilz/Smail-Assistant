Do you want more insights into noncore sectors and the profiles offered to
institute students?

Want to know how we interact with companies like McKinsey, BCG, Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan?

Ever wondered how working in one of the most professional teams in the
institute will be?

Want to know about the initiatives that you will be spearheading this year
as a part of the team?

If you are curious about the answers to the above questions, turn up for
the Fundae session for Aspiring IPR Coordinators. This session is for 2nd
years only.

CRC 101

See you there.

PS: All 2nd years who are interested in joining Placement team are welcome
to attend, we are sure you are going to return with a lot of insider
information about noncore sectors.
