GIAN Course on Biomedical Systems from 25th July to 5th August

Body:
b'     Two week, 2 credits, GIAN Course on Biomedical Systems  (25 th </strong  July 2016 to 5 th  August 1016)  Venue: ESB 244, Department of Electrical Engineering  IIT  Madras  Chennai 600036  Professor Steffen Leonhardt 1  of RWTH Aachen, Germany 2       &nbs;p;  2   (a) Objectives of the course   Participants should get a basic understanding of circulatory, ventilator and renal physiology. Participants should obtain a basic understanding how to model pathophysiology and manmachine interaction using first principles and electrophysiological analogues. Participants should obtain an understanding of the function of lifesupporting devices. Participants should obtain a basic understanding of upcoming new monitoring technologies (b) Overview of the Course: Participants should get a feeling for the growing demand for surgical simulators and the connected technologies. This course gives an overview of engineering physiology and medical devices supporting patients in lifethreatening conditions. In particular, the course covers circulatory physiology, lung physiology, cerebrospinal fluid physiology, glucose metabolism and renal physiology as well as therapeutic devices currently used in clinical practise. These include heart pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, ventricular assist devices, total artificial hearts, artificial ventilators, ECMO devices, anaesthesia devices, hydrocephalus shunts, sensors to measure blood glucose level, insulin pumps, dialysis machines.  Furthermore, the following topics will be covered: determination of hemodynamic parameters using optical sensors and other noncontact sensors and opthalmic anesthesia training and simulation.    1  Introduction to circulatory physiology I  15  Dialysis machines td    2  Introduction to circulatory physiology II  16  Modalities for noncontact cardiovascular monitoring (capacitive ECG, magnetic impedance)    3  Heart pacemakers and implanted defibrillators I  17  Dynamics of blood flow    4  Heart pacemakers and implanted defibrillators II  18  Invasive measurement of constituents of blood    5  Ventricular assist devices (VADs) and total artificial hearts (TAHs)  19  Optical sensors for the measurement of venous blood flow dynamics    6  Lung physiology and pathophysiology I 20 Measurement of oxygen saturation in arterial blood  7  Lung physiology and pathophysiology II 21 An analytical model for the attenuation light  8  Artificial Ventilators  22  Calibration free measurement of venous blood flow   9  Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenators (ECMO devices)  23  Model based measurement of oxygen saturation in arterial blood   10  Anaesthesia devices I  24  Noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin content    11  Anaesthesia devices II  25  Fundamentals of ocular system   12  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) physiology and to hydrocephalus therapy  26  Ailments and treatments in ocular system</td  13  Glucose metabolism and patho physiology of diabetes mellitus  27  The cataract surgery and opthalmic anesthesia   14  Introduction to renal physiology  28  Opthalmic anaesthesia training system  All the interested participants MUST register through the GIAN Portal  ().
