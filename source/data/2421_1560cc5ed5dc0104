 Hello All!

 Greetings from the media club!
 It has definitely been a splendid journey for all of you at our very own
 insti!
 As a token of gift to all the passing out batch we are planning to make a
 great video for you guys.
 Please send in your videos (Candid ones) on this email id.


 What kind of videos?    Any video with with lovely memories of yours
 (insti or with junta). (On a scale of 010 , 10 being the worst one .... we
 encourage a video rated 19 also  :P :P).
 (Remember it's going to be on youtube :P).

 Can send youtube links, drive links.. etc.
 We'll be mixing these videos with the videos taken during convocation.
 People who send in videos are more likely to be focused during the
 convocation capture. :P :P.
