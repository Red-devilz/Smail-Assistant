hi sapna,

thequestion reads as the followingC2A0

c)Sapana is a little crazy, nothing wrong with that. She wakes up and
flips a fair coinC2A0repeatedly until she flips her second tails. She the
n
goes and eats at irctc for each head sheC2A0flipped. Let M be the money i
rctc
makes from SapanaE2s each day. What is the daily expectedC2A0money
 to be
made from her expenditure?

Now,in this question the subject eats at IRCTC for as many times it flip
s
a heads? what is the relation between the number of coin the subject flips
and the money IRCTC makes? can we assume it to be some value?
