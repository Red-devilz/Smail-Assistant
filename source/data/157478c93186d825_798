For the past few days, someone has been stealing my newspaper from the
entrance of my room (334). Today also he did the same. The newspaper guy
drops it off  around 8:00 am but I am down to pick it up only after 12:00
am because of my class schedule, so it is not as if the paper sits outside
all day.
If any gangaster guy is doing this, then please stop it because someday or
another I would be able to catch you.

Dude, if you wanna read newspaper then I) start visiting the first room
near the ganga entrance or ii)  later in the evening come to my room (334)
to pick up the newspaper after I'm finished or the best one iii)start your
own subscription.
