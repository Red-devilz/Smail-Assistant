 Hello!

 We shall be having an inter hostel football tournament for the sophomores
 (ED & NavArch Dual junta) and the postgraduates who've come to Ganga this
 year.

 So, please fill this
 form
 if you are interested. This will help me put up the teams and fixtures
 accordingly.

 Also, people interested to become Sports Sec volunteers, please ping me.

 Thank you.
