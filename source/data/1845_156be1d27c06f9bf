Dear Professor,


We have received requests from students and faculty about how students can
learn to solve the types of problems that we ask as part of the Google APAC
2017 University Test . For many,
they haven't had the exposure. To help, we are hosting an information
session tomorrow at 7pm. Requesting you to kindly circulate the below note
to your students.


Thanks much, Deepak Sridhar
