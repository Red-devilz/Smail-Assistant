Re: Gangasters Fire and Ice event

Body:
@nishant: thanks for being active and actually interested in the budget
allocation. But let me tell you this, I myself cannot change an event from
tech soc. In one meeting I was the only one who was against fire n ice but
all other TAS wanted this event to be there as it increases the
participation.

In another meeting I was done with all other TAS and our tech soc head. In
that meeting I raised a point that fire n ice is not technical event. But
other 6 people with majority concluded that fire n ice is a technical event
and coding event is not _ .

Any sane person can tell this event need to be scrapped but if its there
then I am bound to participate. I personally wany to take tech soc lite and
start projects but due to lack of interested junta I am not able to start
the projects.

 None taken.
 Well, I suppose I do need a life. :P
 This event certainly needs to be scrapped.
 30k could be spent on something far better.
 Our TAS would agree.(as opposed to other hostels)
