By    Professor Douglas Allen  Department of Philosophy, University of Maine, USA. </p   On 15th March 2016  Venue: HSB 356,4pm to5pm   Abstract:   span span Is the philosophy and practice of Mahatma Gandhi focusing on morality, truth, nonviolence, tolerance, interrelated selfdevelopment and harmony with others and nature  significant or largely irrelevant for India today? This may seem like a silly question. After all, Gandhi is Bapu, father of the nation, the glorified Mahatma who sacrificed his life for India. I shall submit that for the dominant group of modern Indians who control the economic, political, and technological wealth and power, for a variety of antiGandhi critics, for those embracing the aggressive Hindutva ideology, and even for many conservative Gandhian devotees, Gandhi is largely irrelevant for India in 2016. By way of contrast, in my approach, Gandhi's exemplary life, philosophy, and enduring legacy should be viewed in a dynamic, openended, contextualized way. We must engage in selectively and creatively reformulating what is of value in Gandhi's philosophy for our contemporary contextualized world. Gandhi does not have all of the answers, but when selectively reappropriated and integrated with other complementary approaches, Gandhi's moral, spiritual, economic, and cultural approach is deeply significant in critiquing and resisting much of what is happening in India and in the world in 2016 and in providing desperately needed alternatives .  span   About the speaker:  span span"
