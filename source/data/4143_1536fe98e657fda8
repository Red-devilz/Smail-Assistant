Hello everyone,

First of all, sorry for the inconvenience caused yesterday, as few of the

circumstances.

Now, to all the nominees, please be ready with presentation of the
manifesto at the time of soap box.

First, a candidate will present his manifesto in the order mentioned below
which will be followed by a Q/A session.

1. Sports Secretary.
2. Health and Hygiene Secretary.
3, Social Affairs Secretary.
4. Hostel Legislator.
5. Literary Affairs Secretary.
6. Technical Affairs Secretary.
7. Hostel General Secretary.

Candidates, please bring  few hardcopies of the manifesto as well.

Also, Refreshments will be provided.



Regards
