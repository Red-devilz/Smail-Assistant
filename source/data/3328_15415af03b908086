Subject:
Re: Gangasters Playing of Music in Ganga

Body:
This is juvenile behaviour. You could have just asked the guys who were
playing if they could just reduce the volume. Just because you are not
participating in some thing, does not mean it is not important for others.
If these guys are giving up on their sleep and practising for an event,
then it probably means quite a lot to them. In a hostel, learn to adjust to
the community life and do not be a prick.

 Thanx Samir.
 As far as my argument is concerned.
 Once Shoaib Akhtar said for Dravid  " You can bowl any bowl to him, he
 will just leave it. But once you bowl him a bowl worth boundary, he will
 definitely give you a boundary"
 So I will definitely reply a comment that is worth replying.

 OR, instead, you could get up and join the band :)

 If you are attending classes in those hours, might they also not be?

 Guys,
 This is just to inform you all that I talked to hostel manager about
 the band practice going in the music room. I told him that this is very
 disturbing at least for the rooms just above the music room and office.
 They played till 3 in the morning yesterday night which is quite
 disturbing. I asked him to tell these guys ( via Gen.Sec and Lit.Sec to
 practice in the morning hours (as we all be attending classes) and in the
 evening ( 5pm to 8pm). When I asked him what if they played after 8pm, he
 directly told me to call security and inform warden directly about this.
 Hence Music should not be played after 8pm. If it happens, you can do
 the same as well. Call 8080 and warden( his mobile no. is outside office)
