Hello everyone,

The past week, we have hosted a huge number of events in the run up to our
70th Independence Day celebrations. Students have participated in essay
writing competitions, elocution competitions and music competitions among
others, with the overarching theme being patriotism. But is this all that
patriotism is about? We, the student representatives of IIT Madras, feel
otherwise. True patriotism is making a real change on the ground and we
feel that it is time for the students of IIT Madras to start taking baby
steps towards making the world we live in a better place - a place without
dirt and garbage.

The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched by the Govt. of India in order to
make a 'Clean India'. It's been nearly two years since this campaign has
been launched and we feel that one small, but important way in which we can
make a change in society is by joining this campaign and creating awareness
about the same. Towards this end, on the *morning of 14th of August at 5:30
am*, *we plan to hold a Cycle Rally from Gajendra Circle to Besant Nagar
beach.This shall be followed by a clean-up drive in Besant Nagar beach and
distribution of gifts to cleanliness workers at the beach and in our
institute. A parallel cleanliness drive will also be taking place in our
campus.*

Students interested in being a part of this are requested to fill this
<https://goo.gl/forms/6zksdtQW4QE84D8i1> form. All participants shall get
free T-Shirts. Safety equipment for clean-up and refreshments shall be
provided.

Let's make a better and cleaner India, together.

Jai Hind!
