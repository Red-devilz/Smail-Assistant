Subject:
New firewall testing

Body:
On Tuesday (15th March) we had tried a transition of all the hostels
to our new firewall  this had been in testing in CC for about a week
and was functioning fine, and had also been tested in one of the
hostels without trouble. However, once the entire load came onto it,
we found that it performed very poorly and left most of the hostel
zone without a connection that night. I would like to apologise on
behalf of computer centre for the inconvenience.

We have reverted to the netaccess mode until the end of quizzes. In
the meantime, the vendors have indicated possible solutions to the
problems with the new firewall and we expect that once corrected the
situation should not arise again. After quizzes, we will once again
test the new firewall, more gradually this time. This has to be done
since the netaccess firewall is showing some strain and is not a
longterm solution.

As some of you have pointed out, there seem to be some issues with the
"logout/keepalive" window that need to be sorted out for this to work
 we are currently looking at all alternatives and will try these out
as well. There will be a small period of disruption after quizzes
until the new techniques stabilize, I request your cooperation and
understanding in this. Unfortunately, the problems arise only when the
complete hostel load goes onto the firewall, which is why our week of
testing in CC and other departments did not show any of the issues
that we faced under full load.

Thank you for your cooperation.
