 Respected Sir,

 I am interested in taking GN5002 Discovering Creativity course, but I have
 labs in P and S slot which will clash with L slot. Is the course being
 offered in L slot as listed in the Elective list, or will it be in the
 evening as was the case previously?

 Really sorry for the sudden nature of request as the deadline is tomorrow.

 Best,

 GN5002 Discovering Creativity will be offered in the coming semester
 (JanMay 2017)

 This course will help each of one to discover several facets of
 creativity  both in the outside world and within ourselves.  We will learn
 that creativity is more than just idea generation.  Doing this course will
 help you gain confidence in your own creativity, which in turn, will
 increase the confidence in yourself.
