IITM Affinity Program || Unveiling the Deals

Body:
Hello folks,

Greetings from the IITM Associations Team, I&AR Student Council!


There is something which connects us to Insti emotionally. We, in some way
or other, take pride in being a part of it. With IITM Affinity Program, we
give this emotion and pride a shape, something a bit more deeper to connect
to.

What better way to do so than deals which gives discounts and privileges
exclusively for our IITM family!!

At Associations Team, we work hard to add value to your identity as an
IITian

because...

YOU DESERVE IT!

To accommodate the size of our dream, we are working hard to extend the
geographies and extent of its reach to our sister IITs, making Affinity
Program a pan India privilege to all IITians across verticals

Watch the IIT Madras Affinity Program  Curtain Raiser

Be a part of launch, add your thoughts and grab unlimited goodies (Yes you
read it correct!) 

To have a first look at the deals and know how to avail them, be there.
