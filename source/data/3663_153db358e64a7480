Date and Day:   ;   06 th  April 201 (Wednesday)  Time:             04:30 PM </p Venue:    ;        MSB 104  Tea:              04:15 PM  Host:            Dr.  Murugaiyan Amirthalingam  Abstract: Welding is a key manufacturing process which is employed successfully to fabricate many of the products and much of the infrastructure on which we depend. Unfortunately there are examples of catastrophic structural failure associated with welding and many cases of poor productivity associated with poor joint quality and repair. These problems are associated with the fact that welding is a  special process as defined in ISO 9000 on the basis that  welds cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and testing of the product to ensure that the required quality is met.  The answer to the first part of the title is clearly no; but what can be done to ensure adequate quality and avoid failures? The simple answer is procedural control; in which welding parameters are developed and tested on a representative test piece and the proven parameters are replicated in production. The presentation will discuss the tools which are needed to ensure that this process can be followed and some new developments which may assist the welding engineer to cost effectively achieve the required quality.   About the speaker:  Emeritus Professor of Materials Welding and Joining  University of Wollongong, Australia, Director of the Australian Defence Materials Technology Centre Ltd.,Director of the Welded Structures Foundation, FWeldI, CEng, Honorary Fellow WTIA. John has worked in the welding related research and development area since for 50 years. Originally with Rubery Owen UK then from 1969 to 1985 for the BOC group in the UK and Australia. . In 1985 he took up a position at Cranfield University, where he later became Head of the Welding Group. Prof. John moved to the University of Wollongong in November 1995 to take up the Chair in &nbs;p;materials Welding and Joining. At Wollongong John was responsible for coordinating welding research and education activities.         Dr. M.
