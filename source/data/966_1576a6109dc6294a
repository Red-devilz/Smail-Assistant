Hello all,

Greetings from CFI and Horizon!

Gravitational waves. Mangalyaan. Higgs boson.

From Quarks to Quasars, everything comes under the dark of matter (well,
about 5% of it :P). The Physics and Astronomy club presents From Quarks to
Quasars, an orientation for the insti junta (especially freshies) to get a
feel of the club. We shall be releasing our project statements, upcoming
sessions and something new at the end of the session!

But wait! The details?

Space time coordinates: (29th Sept (Thursday) 8:00 p.m, CRC 103)

Be sure to mark your calendars! And in case of doubts, do drop in a mail
