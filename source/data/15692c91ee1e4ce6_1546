Greetings from Career Development Team!

Hope all of you are preparing well for your placements and internships.

Although you prepare well enough in the technical aspects, during the
recruitment process it also matters how well your resume describes your
profile and your performances in group discussions & personal interviews.
So it's time to gear yourself up to perform well in these areas too!
