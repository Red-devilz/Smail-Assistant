Linux installfest

Body:
Hi All,

We are conducting Linux installfest on 27th August (Saturday) at 2 PM
in ESB 127.

Please fill this  form if you are
attending.

To save time during the installfest, we request you to make a bootable USB
pendrive.

To do so, go to this link  to download the
appropriate Ubuntu ISO file and follow the instructions therein to make a
bootable USB pendrive.

Since the link provided is intranet, the download rate should be faster.

 If you are not sure which ISO file to use, choose the 16.04 (x64 bit).


Venue : ESB 127

Date : 27 August 2016
Time : 2 PM
