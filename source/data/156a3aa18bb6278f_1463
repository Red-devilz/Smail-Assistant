Forward to all department 3rd years,

Hey everyone,
           First and foremost,good luck for day 1 internships from
internship team!!! Hope you get the company you desire.

*Few quick reminders:*
1)Attend all the intern procedures of every company you have applied for
2)Formals for GDs and interviews-compulsory
3)On 21st,have atleast 5 copies of your resumes for each company.Also keep
few A4 sheets and pens handy.Do not take printouts in the last minute.
4)Certificates and grade cards are NOT required
5)Most of the interview shortlists will be out tomorrow late night(as late
as 5 am :P).Keep checking the portal regularly
6)Have your phone ready to make and take calls(mostly for interview and GD
slots)
7)Have a couple of biscuit packets in your bag.Will come in handy

Keep cool and take a deep breath,the entire placement team and internship
team are there to support you :D
Again all the very best :)
