Hello all! Greetings from *C**FI*

Greetings! We were to have a session on 27th (Saturday), but it has been
cancelled due to rains. Clouds did play the spoilsport!
However, we shall be having an informal orientation for the freshers on
Tuesday (30th August) at 6:30 p.m, at

*HSB 210 (in Physics Department).*
As usual, please keep checking our facebook
<https://www.facebook.com/horizon.iitm/> page for *instant updates*, as we
shall be unable to send in information real fast via smail!

Cheers,
