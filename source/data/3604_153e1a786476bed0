Subject:
Gangasters Re: Hostel Night theme responses

Body:
I am not saying... Whether % was right or wrong. I said sharing % only is
not enough. Why not make the list public.
Then one may check if his name is there or not with the response he had
chosen. I just wanted to make the process more transparent. It wasn't a
comment on your integrity. And of course, Beach was my preference also.
