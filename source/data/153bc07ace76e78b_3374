Looking for a web developer
To:

I am developing a site for MBA aspirants with educational content. The
website is currently functional and uses Django/python 2.7 and PostgreSQL.
Users can currently register/login and get access to content, quizzes
(timed & untimed) and forums. This does not involve e-commerce.

I require the following additional developments on the site:

- Develop another timed test module using XML.

- Add a few admin features to the timed test modules

- Existing user progress summary page contains just the numbers. Will
require a chart-based display of the summary.

- Other JScript/HTML changes which I shall discuss in person.

Would be great if you could share this with CSE students. Interested
students can contact me on +91 9498073463, or this email id, to discuss
overall requirements and remuneration. Detailed spec requirements will be
shared prior to commencement of work.

Grateful if you could share your mobile number as well.

Thanks and Regards,
Vignesh
