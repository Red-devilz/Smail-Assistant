 Our tech room has wifi router

 ID : Ganga Tech Room
 Password : gangatechroom

 It is written on the white board also but still every time I give keys to
 someone, they reset the password to something else. Kindly please avoid
 doing this again and again even if you forget the password then just call
 me and ask the password but don't reset the router as it causes unnecessary
 pain to other students. Anyone who will come to tech room afterwards will
 reset the password.

 I hope you will cooperate with me and avoid changing the password.
