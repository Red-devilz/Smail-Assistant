 The fixtures can be found here

 All Round 1 and Round 2 matches shall happen before lunch.

 I've already informed the Round 1 teams and since we have 9 teams who've
 registered, only two of them have the first round. Everyone else has
 progressed to the second round. Round 2 matches will start at 10. The
 tentative time of commencement of the other matches has been put on the
 sheet. Please be on time.

 Regards

 Thank you
