ABSTRACT :	


Biophotonics is a new and vastly promising field providing better solutions
 to lingering diagnostics challenges. Replacing or reducing invasive and pa
inful procedures with optical techniques is being heavily pondered. Behavio
ur of light interaction with biological tissue gives information regarding 
the morphological structure of the tissue. Polarization property  of light 
is found to be useful in  this regard.  While the Stokes vector describe th
e state of polarization of light source, Mueller calculus is used to define
 the way in which the  incident light polarization state is transformed by 
the tissue, which is essentially an optical medium. The changes occurring i
n the tissue ultrastructure during disease progression such as malignant gr
owth reflects total tissue optical scattering properties which could be cha
racterized from the derived Mueller matrix value. In the study, we probe ho
w changes are incurred in the Mueller matrix and derived indicators of a ti
ssue during expected morphological changes in the subcellular structure dur
ing a neoplastic growth.

Experimentally obtained Mueller matrix and depolarisation index parameters 
of normal and tumor tissue phantom samples show distinguishable difference.
 It is observed that the tissue Mueller matrix and its derived components a
re insensitive to tissue absorption, thus eliminating the interference effe
cts of absorption in tissue scattering measurement. For further investigati
on and understanding of these differences that is contributed by the tissue
 total scattering, an optical model of the tissue is computationally simula
ted. The motivations for the model are derived from the histopathological c
hanges in the tissue during cancer progression. The nucleus size undergoes 
an approximate doubling while cell crowding in unit probed tissue volume in
creases during the development of cancer. Modeling the cell nuclei as main 
scattering centers, a systematic computational study using Monte carlo meth
od on how Mueller matrix elements vary for an increase in scatterer size an
d number density is performed.  It is possible to selectively discriminate 
the changes in the overall scattering, giving more insight to its contribut
ing factors such as size and volume fraction of the nucleus during the deve
lopment of malignancy. 



                                                                           
          // ALL ARE WELCOME //
Thanks
