RE: Penalty for not attending to the LAB VIVA in respective slots
 given by the TA

Body:
b'     This refers to all groups. If you don\'t come for the viva and you have not communicated this to your TA beforehand, you would be given 0 for the viva in that lab.    Chester       Sent from Samsung Mobile      Original message   From: anthony balaraju   Date:2016/10/21 17:19 (GMT+05:30)   To: osiitm_2016   Subject: Penalty for not attending to the LAB VIVA in respective slots given by the TA     ONLY TO BATCH 8  Only one team (of batch8) has  communicated  and finished their VIVA in the prescribed slot.  I am sorry to say that the other teams of Batch 8 are going to get penalty/zero marks for their VIVA of lab4.    @ALL BATCHES   Please note that such action is applicable to any team , if you do not take the VIVAs seriously (not in preparation but at least in responding to the corresponding TA). TAs will be waiting for you in those slots and wasting their time.        You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups &quot;osiitm_2016" group.
