 Hello all! Greetings from CFI

 Greetings from Horizon, The Physics and Astronomy club of IIT Madras!
 We hope the semester began well for everyone. We are back to observation
 now, with an observation session on the Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus
.

 Not explaining the jargon, the bottom line is one can see Venus and
 Jupiter within 0.5C2B0 of each other, which means we should be able to
 get
 them both in the same field of view! For the stargazers, we have some mo
re
 info here .

 So When?: 27th August 2016 (Saturday)
 But Where?: HSB Rooftop
 At What time?: 6.30 p.m

 The rooftop is accessible to students through the stairs opposite to the
 UG Physics lab. We will try to capture the planets in the same field, so
 do
 get your cameras!

 We will be having an informal orientation during the observation session
 for the Freshers. So do attend if you don't have any plans of Saturday
evening
 outing!

 Note: The sky has been bad off late, and there has been a huge cloud
 cover. So do keep checking our Fb page
  for updates!

 For more queries, please contact:
 Vishal:+91970883656
 Sunil: +918682842342
 Harsha: +919790468990

 Cheers!
