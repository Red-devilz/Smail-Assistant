Body:
1. It looked like CPU0 was getting the Rescheduling interrupt twice as many
times as the others. Why is this the case? Is it because CPU0 is running
some user program that blocks for user input frequently?
2. The local timer interrupts were also not uniform. 6 out of 8 CPUs had
got about 100,000 when I ran it, while 2 of them had only 40,000.

This is interesting. Can you shed some light on your machine's
configuration.

3. The Thermal event interrupts were the only interrupts that were uniform
for all CPUs. I think this is because all CPUs need to be cooled down
together since they are close by and there is no way of cooling down one
while keeping the others running.

looks like you are running on a Laptop, which have more heating issues.

4. PCI MSIs are present for various devices like ethernet, sound card,
etc., but not for USB. Are the USB MSIs grouped under PCIe MSI and the
device driver then does the interpretation?

USB interrupts are a bit different.
A USB device would send (something like) and MSI interrupt to a USB host
controller.
The USB host controller is a PCIe device.
It would then send an MSI to the IO-APIC.

(So in a sense, all USB devices, would use the same interrupt line). The
USB host controller
is smart enough to distinguish one device's interrupt from another.
