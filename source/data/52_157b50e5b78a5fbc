We had earlier spoken to you regarding a project on building a library 
consisting of a few nontrivial algorithms. However we have decided 
against pursuing the same this since we found it difficult to find an 
algorithm that does not already have a reasonable implementation.

We planned on implementing an Intelligent desktop client for Smail. The 
motivation behind this choice is based on the fact that we receive many 
emails, every month via Smail. Hence our client aims to filter/classify 
mails(based on user preferences) and categorize these emails into 
various bins. The reason this is different from Gmail's existing 
filters is that we can create better filters/ customization since it 
specifically targets mails sent via campus mail.

Our tool must be able to automatically recognize important 
events(quizzes/talks/ deadlines)  from the emails based on user 
preferences, and add them to a calendar(say google calendar). Also we 
plan to add a scheduler that schedules your assignments, Seminars and 
other events based on the timing and the priority of the event. We 
could additionally create integration with Todo lists based on email 
content.


Our project would consist of some Machine learning, API usage for 
Gmail, Calendar etc, some generic programming and some GUI design. We 
would be like to ask you if the above mentioned project is of the 
required scale you are expecting of and also tangible within the given 
time frame. What are you opinions on the same?

Thank You for your time.
