Dear all,

Apology for the confusion! The venue for ACM is *ICSR Auditorium* and not
CLT!

Hello,

Greetings from E-Cell, aka the Entrepreneurship Cell of the institute!

It's time when the E-Cell will finally be having its ACM (Aspiring
Coordinators Meet) with an aim to recruit its coordinators and thus, you
will get a chance to be a part of this organisation.

The primary work of *E-Cell *is to spread awareness about the vast
opportunities that entrepreneurship provides and motivate the budding
entrepreneurs, through the flagship* Sprouts program*, lecture series,
workshops, brainstorming sessions and other intra-institute competitions.

Currently, one of the best teams in the institute, *E-Cell *has grown
rapidly within its last few years of inception. We seek to be an exemplary
organization for selecting, mentoring, launching and supporting young
people into techno-business entrepreneurship.

The Aspiring Coordinators Meet is planned for the following departments:-
a) *Events, Networking and Outreach*,
b)* Student Relations and Onground Publicity*
c) *Creative Media Publicity*
d) *Sponsorship and PR*
e) *Logistics and Finance*
f) *Design*
g) *Editorial and Research*

The ACM will happen on:
*07-08-16 (Sunday)* at 6*pm* in *CLT*

The applications will be released the very same day after the ACM.

All students interested in applying to any *E-Cell *2016-17 coordinator
position are strongly advised to attend the ACM. We have positions open for
all the students, Undergraduate and Post graduate.

In case of any queries,
