Quiz Club || Anime Quiz || 28th October, 7 PM || HSB 354

Body:
Hey all,

Do the names 'Naruto', 'Luffy' and 'Goku' ring a bell?
Does the intense action in One Punch Man and Attack on Titan excite you?
Does the quote 'I'll take a potato chip... and EAT IT' bring back memories
of Death Note?

If so, then now's your chance to show off your anime knowledge and put all
those hours of bingewatching to good use.

IIT Madras Quiz Club presents Anime Quiz 2.0

Where? Hsb 354

When?: 28th October (Friday), 7:00 PM

Teams of 3 or less and prizes for the top 3 winners along with a number of

with a pen!
