Dear Students,

We have formed a committee to monitor the functioning of campus cafe (Staff
Canteen). The caterer is expected to maintain a Complaint book at the
counter. Please make use of it.

Currently, If you have any complaints/suggestions regarding Campus Cafe,
please fill this form <https://goo.gl/forms/bZ3lrrRRUPmcQsyn1>. We will
take action only if we get enough responses. So, please give your feedback
by filling the form.
