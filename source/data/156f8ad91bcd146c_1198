Hello all,



TataInnoverse is an Open Challenge competition which has put forward
problem statements based on various real time problems faced by the
different companies in the Tata Group of Companies. You can refer to
the website
link  <http://www.tatainnoverse.com/open-challenges.php>for further details
or for new problem statements which are frequently updated.



Centre for Innovation would like to play a major role in TataInnoverse
challenges, and is working on fine tuning a few in-house projects that can
be fitted to solve the problems provided and their requirements. CFI would
like to support any student who has a concept or a proof of concept for
solving the given problems in terms of mentors or resources.



If you have an idea for the challenge, but do not know how to approach the
solution, or would like to get support from CFI, please fill up this form
