What happens when the entire human race is at a threat of being wiped out
and only one man can stop this?





Multiple Academy Award winner *Tom Hanks* is back to reprise his role as
the brilliant symbologist *Robert Langdon*in the latest *Ron Howard* movie =
"
*Inferno*", the *movie partner of* *Samanvay=E2=80=9916*. The cast also inc=
ludes
one of the most versatile actors the Indian film industry has ever
seen, *Irrfan
Khan*.



Samanvay, over the years has proved to be one of the premier business fests
in the country, engaging the best brains from various reputed institutions
like IIM-A, IIM-B, IIM-C, ISB, XLRI, SP Jain, IIT-Bombay, IIM-K, and many
more. This year, the theme for Samanvay is "*Braving The Economic Tides*",
which portrays the importance of preparedness for industries and business
organisations to meet any future economic turmoil. With many economists
predicting an impending economic shakeout, it is prudent that each industry
contemplates and understands the risks in its respective field, devises
strategies and plans for ways to be stable. Industrial stalwarts and
economic strategists will also be a part of the audience to gain insights
and knowledge and interact with other industrialists to understand the
cascading and contagious effects of an economic recession.

There is a special free screening of *Inferno *roped in by the Samanvay
team for the Insti Junta. The screening will happen at OAT on 16th Oct at 8
pm. See you there!!

*Instructions*

*1.    *
*Please carry your institute ID cards with you.**2.    **Videography is
strictly prohibited inside the OAT during the movie.*
