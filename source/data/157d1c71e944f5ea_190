Subject: Pledge for World Trauma Day - 17th October 2016

Dear Poojan,

According to the World Health Organization, trauma is the leading cause of
death and disability across the world. In fact, the WHO says, one person
dies on India=E2=80=99s roads every 5 minutes - a figure projected to rise =
to one
every 3 minutes by 2020! That is 360 deaths every day - equivalent to a
jumbo jet (A340/600) crashing. And while that would make people sit up and
take notice, the fact that more people die in road crashes than due to
malaria or TB, remains nothing more than a silent modern epidemic.

To this effect we request you to kindly hand this pledge to all students.


*As IIT Madras student, On World Trauma Day, I solemnly pledge to:*

*- Be aware of and follow all traffic rules *

*- Always wear a seatbelt or helmet when travelling*

*- Not use my mobile phone while driving or walking on roads*

*- Make way for an Ambulance instantly *

*- Stop and offer help whenever there is an accident *
*- Discourage drunk driving*

Warm Regards,
