<div><strong>Abstract:</strong></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Societal grand challenges identified across the globe such as harvesti=
ng solar energy, advancing human health and wellness, minimizing carbon foo=
t print, improving food safety and security, demand continuous improvements=
 in the current technologies to
 push boundaries as well as require the development of completely new techn=
ologies. Addressing the above societal problems through nontraditional rese=
arch approaches could open up new opportunities for the advancement of scie=
nce and technology. This seminar
 will provide an overview of the research in the Nano Electrochemistry Labo=
ratory at the University of Georgia in areas of solar energy conversion, en=
ergy storage, medical diagnostics, bioremediation, agricultural and food sa=
fety technologies using non-traditional
 electrochemical engineering. For example, the natural functions of redox e=
nzymes and/or cells could be manipulated or modified through electrochemist=
ry for a specific end-application such a biosensor, fuel cell or bio-solar =
cell. Similarly, the native metabolism
 of a microorganism could be manipulated for fuel or energy production in a=
n electrochemical cell. The natural photosynthetic process in photosyntheti=
c machineries could be genetically engineered for electricity generation in=
 a biological solar cell. Also,
 the material issues plaguing the energy storage technologies, could be add=
ressed by nanoscale science and engineering. The talk will introduce how el=
ectrochemistry, chemical engineering, material science, biology and nanotec=
hnology could complement each other
 in addressing the societal grand challenges.&nbsp; <br>

<div>Dr. Ramaraja Ramasamy is the Inaugural Chair and an Associate Professo=
r of Biochemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Georgia. H=
e received his B.Tech in chemical and electrochemical engineering from CECR=
I in 2001 and received his Ph.D.
 degree in chemical engineering from the University of South Carolina in 20=
04 in the area of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. After grad=
uation, he held research positions at the Pennsylvania State University and=
 Air Force Research Laboratory before
 joining UGA in August 2010 as an Assistant Professor, and later promoted t=
o Associate Professor in 2015. He is currently the Chair of the school admi=
nistering biochemical and biological engineering programs at UGA. His resea=
rch interest lies in non-traditional
 electrochemical engineering applied to biosensors, bio-solar cells, batter=
ies, fuel cells and related systems. His research group consists of 9 gradu=
ate and undergraduate students. He has authored 54 publications and 5 paten=
ts. He has received over $2 million
 in individual research funding and more as a collaborator.&nbsp; He is a m=
ember of the electrochemical society. He can be reached at rama@uga.edu. Mo=
re information about his research interests could be found from the website=
