 This is in regard with the exotic performances (:P) to be put up for the
 Hostel Night.
 So anyone interested in putting any type of performance maybe singing,
 maybe dancing or any other talent that you have and want to showcase it in
 front of the entire hostellers, this is your chance to show your hostel
 feel as well!
 Interested junta fill in the spreadsheet at the earliest!!
