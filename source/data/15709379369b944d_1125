Body:
Most sensor kits come with an Arduino included. So, since we've already
allocated budget for getting Arduino and Mega boards, you could just buy
those which come with sensor kits. That would probably be cheaper than
getting them seperately. Also, most of these kits have sensors like TSOP IR
sensor, Proximity sensor, Motion sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, Temperature
sensor, etc. which might be helpful for some gen electronics stuff.
