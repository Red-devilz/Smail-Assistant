Re: Gangasters BUDGET

Body:
Most sensor kits come with an Arduino included. So, since we've already
allocated budget for getting Arduino and Mega boards, you could just buy
those which come with sensor kits. That would probably be cheaper than
getting them seperately. Also, most of these kits have sensors like TSOP IR
sensor, Proximity sensor, Motion sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, Temperature
sensor, etc. which might be helpful for some gen electronics stuff.

 You can always suggest sensor kits or eextronic modules which you need in
 hostel and we will try to make it available for you. The factors of
 consideration will be:
 1) Useful for the hostel/its application part
 2) Having similar budget as compared to individual sensors

 Actually this is the best way that you keep suggesting the things
 according to the budget and the best one will be selected.

 For the Tech part, why not get a sensor kit which includes Ultrasonic,
 Proximity, etc.?. Also, can't we get RFID or Bluetooth modules as well?
 Although they might not be useful for TechSoc, they're still fairly common
 components for IoT related stuff.

 The tentative budget of this year is attached in the mail.
 Please look into it if you missed the GBM by any chance and suggest
 changes.
 Have a good day!
