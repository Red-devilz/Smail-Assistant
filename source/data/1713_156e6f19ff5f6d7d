Re: Survey on online mess registration

Body:
Dear all,

Just a clarification. This survey is not just for opening online
registration of Himalaya messes for girls. The idea is to make all the
messes in Himalaya and Vindhya accessible to all the students.

 Dear all,

 Due to repeated requests from girl students to open messes in Himalaya
 during online mess registration for them, we have decided to take a survey
 from the entire students to know the opinion of majority of students.
 Please take a few minutes of your time to fill this form
 
 .

 Please note that we will only be able to discuss this with administration
 if we get responses from atleast 50% of the entire student community.

 The form will be closed by 11:59 PM, 6th September.
