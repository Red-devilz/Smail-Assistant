Hello guys,
Saahitya, the very first Lit fest of IITM is here and how will it be
complete without an event by Fine Arts Club.

Do you love both narrating stories and making art?
If you do then we have the perfect event for you that combines both your
hobbies. It's time to go looney on your toons, cuz we present the comic
strip workshop + contest during this Saahitya.
So come learn the techniques behind comic strip making and give it a try
too. Come up with a comic strip that narrates a story in five pages or
fewer.
Get ready to have fun and saunter away with prize money at our event
followed by the workshop!
First Prize: 3500/

Second Prize: 2000/Third Prize: 1500/ 
So come and make this event also a big success with your participation.
 Date : 3rd April, Sunday
Time : 10.00am  1.00pm
Venue : CRC 2nd floor
Cheers.
Fine Arts Team
