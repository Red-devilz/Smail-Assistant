Re: Gangasters Hostel Soap Box

Body:
Guys, I think it's important to have manifesto review for all the current
secretaries to see what has been done in the past year. Let this happen
before the soapbox. I hope the aspiring hostel legislators will have an
extra interest in this.

Best regards,
Sethu Madhavan A
