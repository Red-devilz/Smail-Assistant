Re: Gangasters Dispenser cleaning

Body:
How do we close the door of the machines? Most of them, have their latch
broken. Please repair it at the earliest possible. But before that, get the
dispensers clean immediately and discuss the issue later. Cleaning of the
dispensers is the urgency currently.

Regards,
Parth Shah
