Hi all,

The following are the issues that were discussed in the DCC meeting.

1. The current dual degree fifth years have a poster presentation in
November which will count for 30% of the grade (earlier it was 20%) and the
final report and viva (to be held in May) will count for 70% of the grade.

2. They had to install new PCs in systems lab to conduct CS1100 lab. So
students can sit in CS32 and work instead. They have installed new plug
points and ethernet ports.

3. EE5176  Computational photography course can be credited as a
department elective. A new committee has been formed to make a master list
of courses from other departments that can be credited as a department
elective. If you want any course to be added to this list, please send a
mail to me with subject "department elective".

4. The deadline for choosing a project guide for current final year B Tech
students is by the end of this month. For current DD fourth year students,
its

March 2017. 
5. We are requested to park cycles in a orderly manner in front of CSB.

6. There is a new twitter account for our department. @iitmcse. Please
follow it for any news and announcements.

7. It has been made compulsory for final year DD students to attend at
least 3 seminars that happen in the department. Attendance will be taken.

8. If someone in 2014 batch or earlier batches failed in the CS2800 
DSA course, they have to repeat two courses now in the current
offering, CS2700
 Data Structures and

CS2800 Analysis of algorithms. 
9. If you failed in CS1200 Discrete mathematics course, you are allowed
to do MA2060  Discrete mathematics course offered by the Mathematics
department as makeup.

10. Students are not allowed to drop courses without a valid reason 
like health issues or some real trouble in coping with the course. You need
to have a minimum 85% attendance to be eligible to drop course. Both the
course faculty and the FACAD have complete right to deny permission to drop
a course and if you have less than 85% attendance, you will be given a W
grade. However, in case you do not like a course. within the first week,
you are encouraged to drop it and add another course.


Bhuvan Agarwal is this year's DCC rep. Please mail him for any issues you
want to be discussed in future meetings. I have cc him in this mail.

@Bhuvan, I request you to forward this to the current first, second and
third years.

It was a wonderful experience serving in this committee!

Thank you,
