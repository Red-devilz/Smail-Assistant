Dear all,

Find below information regarding DD/MTech/BTech internship from ABB. Please
note that MTech final year and DD final year are eligible for this
internship.

 We urgently need applications for the same in a day or two (max Sunday).
Kindly collate the applications and send them to Prof Krishna Vasudevan
(and cc to me as well). You may notify the students that the selection will
be completed before Monday!






 Hello all,

 ABB is a very well known multinational that has recently signed an MOU
 with IIT Madras. They are interested in students taking up a summer
 internship in one of their research centres (they have many, both in In
dia
 and abroad). Please see below for the areas in which they are intereste
d in
 getting interns. (It says for DD students, but I believe that either BT
ech
 or DD students can apply. If you are entering 5th year in DD, you must
 forego your HTRA stipend for these months as ABB will pay you a stipend
 instead)

 You can contact Prof. Krishna Vasudevan for further information.

 ABB
 E2Bis intending to
 provide up to 10 internships to Institute students per year, for next 
3
 years. The
 E2Binternships (for about 2.5 months) are intended for E2B
DD students (with
 financial support) who could be

 (i) End of 3rd year for those who are interested
 (ii) In end of 4th year and final year, but this will have to be part
 of project, and will need guide's concurrence.

 The areas are, for now:

 Electrical Engineering:

 C2B7       Power electronics system / topology studies for FACTS, HV
