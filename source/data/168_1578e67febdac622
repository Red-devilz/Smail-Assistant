Body:
Prem Krishnaa(CS14b049) and myself Rahul Ramesh(CS14b061) part of team 
Daemon, are assigned to you for the OS Lab3 Viva. Is it possible to 
have the Viva on thursday(Oct 6th) at a time between 11:00 AM to 1:00 
PM since we have a free slot then. Any other time convenient to you is 
also okay, but we prefer this, owing to a couple assignment deadlines 
on Friday

Thanks.
