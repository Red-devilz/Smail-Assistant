 Hi peeps
 We are kickstarting the Ganga's Library today. Since we don't have any
 proper place as of now for keeping books, I'm starting the library from my
 room (222). Look at the list and drop me a message on +919176492137.
 Kindly take it before 7:00 PM, 6th October (after that books will not
 be available) so that you guys can read off during this weekend. The
 library will be resumed after the long weekend and the timings for that
 will be informed later. By the end of Quiz 2, I'll be having a proper
 space for books. Till then, please cooperate.

 Here is the current list
  of
 books.
 PFA the attached rules and regulations approved by Warden. Do read it
 before coming for books.

 People who are going home this weekend do look for your books (fiction,
 novel, etc) and if you wish to donate any of those for Ganga's Library,
 fill up the form
  Collection
 of these books will be done around 15th October. Exact timings and
 dates will be informed later.
