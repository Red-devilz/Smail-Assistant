 interesting to most of you. Its designed for lazy ppl. Please take about 5
 minutes to fill it.

 Here's the google form for customer survey: 

 You may forward it to your respective hostel groups.
 Good work Goje!
 @Aarkesh, are you making the mission statement?

 Sorry for multiple emails.

  This is the link to the live form; you
 may send it to other people.

 The link in the earlier email is for collaborators to edit the form 
 the both of you. No one else can see it.

 @Aarkesh, there was supposed to be a presentation yesterday on
 customer survey and mission statement. I had told Tamboli to convey you
 that. We missed it and 5 marks along with it.

 @Tamboli, when you are given a responsibility, you must complete it.
 If you are going to fail to do so, you need to inform others beforehand so
 it doesn't cause us any loss. Now make the mission statement for the
 product.
 We all have DDPs and assignments but being part of the group means
 you must deliver.

 @Goje/Kaustubh, you can create the google form for customer survey
 for "Ceiling Fan cleaning device".

 @People from my group in Product Design lab, I will take full care
 of next week's presentation and report.
