Hello everyone!

How many times you been fascinated by cartoon shows? Mesmerised by video
game graphics? Floored by animated movies? Ever wonder what goes into
making these beauties?

Well, we plan to show you the how the magic happens. We will take you
behind the scenes and walk you through the process of modelling and
animating your very own clips.

We, the 3D-Animation workshop team,*Shaastra 2017*, brings to you a series
of 3-D Animation sessions, focused on developing animation models from
basics. We will be holding 2 sessions this *Saturday and Sunday (i.e 17th
and 18th Sept)* night between *9pm and 12pm* at *CRC 2nd floor.*.

We will go cover the following in these sessions:

   - Basic introduction to animation and Blender.
   - Primitive 3D modeling with hands on examples.
   - Subdivision Surface modeling with hands on examples.
   - Demonstration on 3D Sculpting.
   - Materials and Texture with hands on examples.
   - Light and Camera Setup with hands on examples.
   - Scene set up and Rendering with hands on examples.
   - Demonstration on Special Effect Simulations.

We will be using Blender <https://www.blender.org/> for these sessions.
While we strongly urge you to download the latest version (from here
<https://www.blender.org/download/>) and install it before coming to the
session, we will have installation files at hand at the start of the
session in case you are unable to do so.Also fill this form

.

A wise man once said "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single
step". Come, let us help you make the first step on the journey to master
3D animation.
