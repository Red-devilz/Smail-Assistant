Subject:
Re: Gangasters Water Dispenser at room no:316

Body:
One more thing is, when there is low amount of water is there in an mounted
water can, monkeys take them out or throw it off from the dispenser and
makes the inner part of dispenser from above. So, it has to be cleaned
thoroughly and then fix the doors. How they are cleaning inside parts of
it? (may be ,,i suggest to use some sort of compressed air or pressurized
water to clean the pipeway passage to outlets.)

 @sowmith kumar. the reason that the dispenser is not using is, it doesnt
 have a proper locking mechanism or latch. So, whenver we put a can on, a
 group monkeys come and messes them on. then nobody use it until its
 cleaned. so we go for other water dispensers.
 and when it was ready, i found this dangling worms inside and i took that
 video footage.

 @Gen Sec. Thanks for taking action to fix locking the door of the
 dispenser cage.
 But, when the dispenser is getting cleaned, make sure that the water flow
 rate from each outlets are normal. Many dispensers have a very feeble flo
w
 rate. In some dispensers Cold or normal water doesn't come out.

 @Nishanth
 the cleaning of the dispenser is done using brush and soap oil(not just
 with water and hands).The person who put the water cans cleans them.
 @lazim
 Dispenser near 316 is cleaned 15 days before also.Please let me know why
 you people are not using that dispenser.If there is any problem it will 
be
 resolved.

 I have got a complaint on wings 265274 and 201232 that someone is
 opening the cap of can and putting them out.Please dont do this.Put them
 back into the box.
 Tomorrow all the dispensers will be cleaned.


 Thank you

 Does any other wing has the same problem please let me know.
 If that is the only can then the problem is not in the water plant and
 the problem might be some people are keeping the water cans outside wit
h
 its cap opened.So there may be  chance of insects entering into the can
.If
 anyone in your wing is doing that,please tell them to close the cap and
 put
 them back in the box.
 From my side,locking system of the cages will be repaired in two
 days.this may prevent monkeys.
 Please close the latches of of cages which are in perfect condition.The
 frequency of cleaning the dispensers is increased to 3 per month.
 Thank you

 Apologies for additional spam.

 How exactly are the dispensers cleaned? Water only? Who cleans them?
 Can the @gensec clarify this?

 The hostel zone and academic zone get water from different RO plants.
 The difference is that academic zone water is paid for by departments
. I am
 not sure about the quality of water that they provide us in the hoste
l
 zone. May be run a test? Any ideas?

 Pathetic.
 I dont know if this was the problem with 'not so cleaned' water
 dispenser or the the water can or the water. they say it is RO treat
ed and
 so and so. what we get is this. that has to be verified in plants.
 The cans are also old. and the dispensers doesnt have a locking
 mechanism for door, not even a latch. the dispenser near Room# 316 i
s not
 usable for a month or more.

 Hope no similar issues in future...!
