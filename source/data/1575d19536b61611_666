Hola Freshers!

After one week of intense practice, we are finally all set to embrace the
magic of Freshie Night 2016!

Just when you thought insti couldn't get any better, we bring to you an
event that will remain etched in your memory as one of the most enchanting
evenings.

Come to *SAC at 6 PM tomorrow (25/9/16)* to experience the magic created by
your batch-mates.

If that wasn't enticing enough, get introduced to one very important rule
of Saarang : No matter what the event is, there's always an after party. So
do not, by any chance miss out on that.

Warm Regards,
