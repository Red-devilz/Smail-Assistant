Dear All,


Congratulations to Ather Energy<https://www.atherenergy.com/> (Tarun Mehta =
and Swapnil Jain) for winning the Economic Times Startup Award 2016, 'Best =
on Campus' category, and IITM Incubation<http://www.incubation.iitm.ac.in>.


Jury comments are interesting:

The Best on Campus category =E2=80=94 where startups founded in colleges ar=
e recognised =E2=80=94 came in for attention and praise. IIT-Madras was esp=
ecially singled out because four out the five in the shortlist were born on=
 the Chennai campus. The eventual winner, Ather Energy, was one of them. Ho=
sanagar actually wanted IIT-Madras to be awarded a prize.
Times Internet Vice-Chairman Satyan Gajwani described the Best on Campus ca=
tegory as "pretty amazing" for throwing up interesting surprises. "It is ve=
ry interesting to see the kind of innovations coming out from these college=
 campuses. It wasn't the usual 'Let's build an e-commerce company'. It's di=
sruptive and different," he said.
