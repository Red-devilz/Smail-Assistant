april 2016.They gave very basic price for both veg and non-veg following as
230 and 270.There was a heavy competition for the same caterers between
four hostel on 8th april.At last we got hotel shelter caterers in a lucky
draw method.As of now compare to other hostels our price was at least so I
have been added extra items each one in both veg and non-veg in the menu
after approval from HAS.Then now final cost is *VEG-250* and *NON-VEG-300.*I
am very happy to share this with you people that everything will be
