ABSTRACT :
	=

Biosensors are becoming a part of everyday life, examples include blood glu=
cose meters and pregnancy test kits. They detect molecules of interest (eg:=
 glucose) in a given sample (eg: blood) with the help of specific biorecept=
or molecules attached to the device. Biosensors are highly useful in the de=
tection of several diseases like malaria, typhoid, dengue, myocardial infar=
ction, HIV-AIDS and etc. However, many diseases such as cancer and myocardi=
al infarction can be diagnosed in early stages with development of highly s=
ensitive biosensor technologies. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) b=
ased sensing has been shown to have single molecule detection abilities. It=
 involves use of enhanced electric field at the surface of gold or silver n=
anostructures for enhancement of otherwise weak Raman scattering signals. C=
onventional Raman scattering instrumentation involves bulky optical microsc=
opic setup for sensitive measurement, which could be avoided by using optic=
al fibers for optical excitation and collection. Further, gold nanostructur=
es could be fabricated on the surface of the optical fiber itself to obtain=
 compact handheld SERS active probes. In this study U-bent optical fiber SE=
RS probes based biosensing is demonstrated for silica and polymer optical f=
iber (POF) probes.

The specific contributions of this work include: (1) Plasma assisted surfac=
e functionalization of POF using atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Di=
scharge (DBD) plasma for obtaining gold nanoparticle coated (or plasmonic) =
POF probes. (2) Demonstration of SERS activity of the plasmonically active =
U-bent fiber probes as a passive substrate as well as an active optical wav=
eguide for evanescent field excitation. (3) Evaluation of biosensing capabi=
lity of the SERS active U-bent probes by realizing sandwich immunoassay on =
bare fiber probe through Raman reporter tagged gold nano-conjugates. An imp=
roved detection sensitivity was demonstrated, by realizing the assay on pla=
smonic probes (instead of bare probe) exploiting generation of hotspots bet=
ween the plasmonic surface and gold nano-conjugates.
