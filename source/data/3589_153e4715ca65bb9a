Subject:
Sickbay menu for minor ailments

Body:
Dear friends,
Based on requests from several students a committee led by Prof. N. Balaji (Warden, Saraswathi) has worked out a sickbay menu with one of our caterers which you may avail on payment basis if you are suffering from minor ailments such as fever, stomach ache, stomach upset, heart burn etc., which does not require hospitalization, but needs certain dietry restriction.  

The following will be mode of Operation:
1.  Sickbay caterer: SGR caterers at Vindhya mess (Ground floor)
2.  This is just a courtesy service given on payment basis, chargable to the student account (on and above your regular mess charges) through OHM on a meal by meal basis and we ask you to utilize it judiciously.
3.  Students can call Mr.Sivaramakrishnan, Unit Manager of SGR, Vindhya mess to make a booking for the sickbay meal (menu given below). 
Mobile: 967709105;            Email: sgrfoodspltd@gmail.com

4.  The meal booking from the menu given below need to be made at least 2 hours in advance.  Sick meal booking will be taken only for meal by meal.  Advance booking beyond a day cannot be taken.
5.  Any cancellation of advance booking need to be made at least 4hr prior to the regular meal time.
6.  In case of hospitalization, the sickbay meal will be delivered only at the hospital.
7.  In case of nonhospitalization, students are responsible for picking up the ordered meal from Vindhya mess after showing proper ID.  If the sick student is not able to pickup, his/her friends can pickup the meal for them from SGR caterers after showing the necessary ID proof. 
8.  In the event that the meals are not pickedup or cancelled after the meal was prepared, the student will be charged for the meal.
9.  Menu options: 
      Idli (Breakfast and Dinner),
      Bread & Jam (no butter) (Breakfast, lunch, dinner) 
      Kichdi (Breakfast, lunch, dinner) 
      Upma with less oil/fat (Breakfast, lunch, dinner)
