Hey,

I wanted to introduce you to work from home internships that provide you
access to real life work while you are still in college. Such internships
usually require 2-3 hours of work commitment and last for 1 - 2 months. At
Internshala, we have over 3800 work from home internships for you to choose
from. We have them in domains like engineering, management, design, media
among others.

The best part - it's completely free and you get paid to do the internship

If interested, you can create an account here (http://internshala.com/
registration/student?utm_source=ISP6&utm_medium=ISP6209PRA) and start
applying to internships.

PS - We also have full time internship opportunities with us. Internshala
is completely free for students and all internship listed come with stipend
and certificate.

Regards,
Pranjal,
Internshala Student Partner
