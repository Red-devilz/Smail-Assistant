[Seminars] Discrete Math colloquium : Talk by Kamal Lodaya,
	Monday  3pm @ Madhava Hall

Body:
b"     Dear All,    Next Discrete Math Seminar will be given by Prof. Kamal Lodaya from IMSc, Chennai. He will talk about Courcelle's Theorem. Details as given below.     Speaker: Prof Kamal Lodaya, IMSc, Chennai.    Title: Courcelle's theorem    Date, Time, Venue: 11/Apr/2016. Monday, 3:00pm to 4:00pm. Madhava Hall (HSB 357).  Abstract: Consider a property of finite graphs written in predicate logic, even allowing quantifiers over sets of vertices and edges. Courcelle (1990) gives an algorithm to check such a property which is linear in the size of the graph, parameterized by a computable function in the treewidth of the graph and the size of the formula describing the property. (Sometimes this is described as a fixed parameter linear time algorithm.) This talk gives a gentle introduction to the logic and the algorithm.         narayanan  PS: Tea/snacks will served at the end of the talk.       "
