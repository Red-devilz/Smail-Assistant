Title  :  Lessons learnt while going from 0 to 1 in my startup journey     Excerpts/ Abstract:  Fail Faster  Pivot  Iterate  " Never give up " Its not just a saying  Bootstrap  What constitutes a founding team  What investors look for at the seed stage  Transforming seed to a series A   Brief Bio   Geetansh Bamania, an enthusiastic entrepreneur and dynamic personality, started his career in engineering from IIT Madras. By the age of 27, Geetansh is already a serial entrepreneur with prior startup forays in community learning (Click2skill) and philanthropic crowd funding (HopeMonkey).  He has also worked with companies like Flipkart, Pepperfry and KPMG.  Having worked in ecommerce companies in the past, Geetansh realized quite early that the ecommerce model would be difficult to turn into a profitable venture in discount driven  income constrained economies.  Renting or subscription seemed the only workable solution for the mass market of consumers in India. Geetansh along with Ajay Nain launched RentoMojo in Dec 2014, to provide frugal furnishing rental solutions to the ever increasing population of migrants in major cities across India looking for quick solutions for furnishing.  He thus built a place where one can rent practically anything that they could have bought online with a mission to bring subscriptions as a new way of shopping. This ambitious startup genius has now revolutionized the way people meet their lifestyle needs by promoting and encouraging newage folks to start.   p       With regards....  Prof. R.
