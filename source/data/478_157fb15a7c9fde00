Please use tomorrow's ML class to ask around and contact such people.C2A0


Alsoi believe it makes sense for people using different languages tools 
to
form teams because that allows them to attack the problem using a larger
set of tools.

Ihave created a different sheet in the same document :

i5kCVD9c/edit#gidD1618763632


If you are unable to form a team of 3 please enter your names/roll numbers
here. Use this to communicate amongst yourselves and form teams of 3 and
enter it in the main sheet :

i5kCVD9c/edit#gidD0


Please note that anyone who is not in teams of 3 by wednesday midnight
(this includes people who have current entered teams of 1 and 2 on the main
sheet) will be assigned teams randomly by the TAs.
