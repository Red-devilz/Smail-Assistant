 Friends, Gourmands and Epicureans,

 Here at the Cooking Club we believe in Equality. And since equality means
 equal representation, a NonVeg Galore must necessarily follow! (our last
 session being quite Vegan.)

 We bring you, Prawn Temperado and Chicken Ghee Roast! May see
 something of a Laurel and Hardy in combination, but let us assure you, this
 combinaiton of Portuguese flavors and Indian spices will leave your taste
 buds quite satiated!


 What? Prawn Temperado and Chicken Ghee Roast

 With? Zaitoon

 Where? Himalaya Ground Floor Mess(Left Side)
 When? 21st August(Sunday), 2:30 PM5:30 PM

 We'll be having 30 participants, in three groups. As usual, we select most
 of our participants on the basis on first come first serve. As for the
