Dear Students

*(all B. Tech. / DD students from 5th semester and higher, and all PG
students)*

Classes for CH5350: Applied Time-Series Analysis (being offered in the =E2=
=80=98F=E2=80=99
slot) will take place at *NPTEL Studio 1 (IC & SR, 3rd floor).* Students
who cannot be accommodated in Studio 1 will be seated in the adjacent
*Conference
Room (on the same floor),* where the class will be telecasted with facility
for teacher-student interaction. The reason for the change of venue (from
MSB 240) is that a video recording of the course is scheduled to be offered
as a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) during the Jan-May 2016 semester.

Classes begin on Wednesday, August 03, 2016 at 11:00 AM.

Thank you for your co-operation. I look forward to seeing all of you
tomorrow.

best wishes,
Arun
