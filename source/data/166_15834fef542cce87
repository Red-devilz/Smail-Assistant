Subject:
Feedback on general facilities

Body:
Dear all,

It has been almost 2 months since we took the last online feedback on
general facilities in the campus. CMGFS Coordinators have tried their level
best to rectify all the complaints/suggestions that was given by students
in the last online feedback. Now it's time for the second online feedback
in the semester from students on all the general facilities in the campus
to serve you better. Please take a few minutes of your time to fill this
form
.
You can fill the form more than once, if you want to give feedback about
more than one facility.

The form will be closed by 11:59 PM, 11th November.
