Hi people,

Madras Christian College will be conducting its inter college theater fest,
Dionysia '16 on 17th September. As a part of their line-up, they have a
monoacting competition, where participants are expected to put up
monologues not exceeding 10 min in duration. We plan to support and sponsor
interested people who would like to participate. Please fill in this form
