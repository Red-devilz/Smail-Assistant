Research Scholars' Day (RSD) is an annual event organised by Research
Scholars of IIT Madras. RSD was kick started in 2012 under the
leadership of Ms. Ishitha kumar (RAS,2012). The aim of RSD is to bring
research scholars under one roof and provide platforms to learn  from
experts, decimate their research outcomes and share their knowledge with
peers across the institute and industry. RSD spans over a week with
events ranging from lecture series by eminent personalities, workshops
on various software and hardware platforms and a research expo where
students showcase their research work through posters and presentations
to the attendees.

We are planning to organise following events in RSD 2017.



1. Research Expo

RSD 2017 provides a platform for aspiring research scholars to showcase
their talent through working models, posters and presentations. We host a
special event called "Explain Your Research in Two Minutes" in which
interested scholars can explain their research in two minutes to colleagues
and a panel of judges. Research Scholars with interesting outcomes will be
recognised with appropriate awards. 


2. Industry  R&D Expo

RSD provides a platform for startups and established companies to showcase
their latest products and research outcomes. We also provide an opprtrunity
to these companies to reach out to our research scholars. This event aims
to make research scholars familiar with the kind of research done in
companies and relate to it.




3. Research Lecture Series by eminent personalities

It is always encouraging and motivating to hear from eminent
personalities. This RSD, we bring some of the wellknown personalities to
share their experiences. We intend to motivate and rejuvenate our research
community through this lectureship series. We are planning for 6  8
lectures during RSD and atleast one lecture in every month.




 4. Panel discussion by industry experts.

We intend to bridge the gap of academy and industry, through panel
discussion, centered towards research across various organizations. We are
inviting R & D heads of various industries to be a part of this event. This
is intended to facilitate a face to face discussion between industry
experts and research scholars.




5. Workshops facilitating research

There are various domains where our research scholars can enhance their
capability. These workshops are intended to help our research scholars in
continuing efficient research and develop their personality. In fact itE2
s a
process to discover themselves.





6. Cultural night & competitions for research scholars

RSD 2017 also aims to motivate research scholars to explore their
cocurricular talents. We have noticed that many research scholars are
excited to participate in cultural events like singing, dancing, mimicry
and fashion shows. We would like to recognise the talented research
scholars through this event.
