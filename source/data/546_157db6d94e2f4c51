Hello peeps
Quizzes are the best time to think of out of the box ideas and hence the
mail.
LitSoc SFM contest is nearing and since we need to start shooting after
quizzes, start thinking of stories (thriller, comedy etc) and we will
meet Friday
night (21st September) at 10pm. People interested in other aspects of SFM
(editing, videography etc) are also required to come.
Venue the evergreen Ganga's Baddy court
People interested in SFM drop me a message or WhatsApp me on +919176492137
PS please be on time

Regards
Shanttam Jain
Literary Affairs Secretary
