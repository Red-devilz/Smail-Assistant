Hello!

We shall be having an inter hostel football tournament for the sophomores
(ED & NavArch Dual junta) and the postgraduates who've come to Ganga this
year.

So, please fill this
form
if you are interested. This will help me put up the teams and fixtures
accordingly.

Also, people interested to become Sports Sec volunteers, please ping me.

Thank you.
