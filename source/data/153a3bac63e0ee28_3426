Subject: Re: Gangasters Hostel Night Theme

Dude I think beach will not be a good idea. I thought about this and seriou=
sly without girls there would be no fun in this kind of theme. And its nigh=
t, this theme will not appeal anyone or even the ambiance also will be a pa=
in and will not even be close to beach.
