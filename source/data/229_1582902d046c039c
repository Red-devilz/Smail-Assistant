A Walk In My Shoes - Accessibility Summit | Shaastra 2017

Body:
Hey Fellas!

To help calm a few nerves during this chaotic period of quizzes and
midsems, Shaastra 2017 invites you to A Walk In My Shoes  a precursor
awareness event of Accessibility Summit.

 We are here to challenge you to a few seemingly impossible tasks: Can you
win a race without actually running? Can you snake through obstacles
without seeing them? Can you pull off an argument without any words? How
about moving backward when you are sure that you are moving forward?

 Well, do you realise that these are very common for a huge number of
people? Accessibility promises an environment which is
disabilityfriendly, yet doesn't necessarily focus on the cool and really
HiTech innovations. It requires a sense of understanding from our society,
free of social stigma.

 Wondering how? Brace yourself and engage in the line up of extremely fun
filled activities and challenges at A Walk In My Shoes on November 3rd,
Thursday.  Be there to experience a whole new dimension of your senses!

Place: Himalaya Lawns
Time: 7:30 pm 

PS:  OnSpot Registrations Open for the Accessibility Summit!!


Cheers,
Accessibility Summit
Shaastra 2017
