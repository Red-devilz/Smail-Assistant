Today's lab.

Dear Students,

Ihope you had a good time in the class.The goal of this lab was to show
you the difficulties of parsing. In the coming labs, you will learn about
tools using which these tasks (and far more complicated ones) can be done
in far easier manner.

Tohelp us learn from each other  I suggest each group to post their co
de
that they developed today on moodle. Suggested file name:
Calc<groupnum.c In the beginning of the file, add a comment giving all
the authors.

Warmregards,

Krishna.
