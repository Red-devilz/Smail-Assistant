Dear all,

It has been a month since the semester has started. We(CMGFS Team) thought
of getting an online feedback from students on all the general facilities
in the campus to serve you better. Please take a few minutes of your time
to fill this form
.
You can fill the form more than once, if you want to give feedback about
more than one facility.

The form will be closed by 11:59 PM, 15th September.
