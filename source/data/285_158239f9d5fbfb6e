Dear all,

Ihave uploaded the marks for P5 on Moodle.

_A note for reevaluations:_
In case if you have any minor changes (not more than 510 lines of code) to
be done in the assignment, kindly meet me between 45 p.m. next Monday
(7Nov2016). Please note that if you intend to make modifications to your
submission, you will have to do so manually in the local copy on my
machine. I'll notify you about the penalty later, which will be decided by
Krishna.

Thanks.
Warmregards,
Aman.
