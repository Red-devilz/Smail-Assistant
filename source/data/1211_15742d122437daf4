American Express Credit Cards (Only for final years)

Body:
Dear all (final years),


This is to inform you that we have American Express stall set up in
Himalaya ground floor. They are giving credit cards to all final year
students. You can find the details of the cards they are offering in the
mail below. These details are given to me by the company. So for any
problem or confusion please contact the company people. Contact details of
the same can be found below in the mail.


One thing I would like to make clear right now is that we as IIT Madras
are just facilitating this for your convenience. We won't come anywhere in
between you (as a client) and American Express. So understand the scheme in
and out before taking any card.


Here is the mail from American Express.
