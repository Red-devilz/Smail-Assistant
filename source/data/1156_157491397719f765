 The Word Games Club brings to you its final freshie event, What's The
 Good Word, open to freshies from all departments, programs and hostels. 
On
 this momentous occasion, it is fit only to quote the Bible.



 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
 was God."


           John 1:1



 Turn up for what? Anagrams. Spoonerisms. Russian dolls. Addagrams.
 Inbetweeners. It's chill if you don't know what any of the above things
 mean. As freshies, nor do we. Nor did we, sorry. Words are cool;
 they're very pun to wield indeed.



 It's chill if this is the first time you're (considering) doing anything
 with words, weE2ll be there to help you along.



 When? E2 Wednesday, 21st September at 6 pm

 Where? E2 CRC 101

 Rules? E2 Teams of two. Written prelims followed by finals for t
he top 8
 teams.


 Bring a pen and a pal. We have chocolates, and gift vouchers worth 1k
 waiting to be won.

 Feel free to contact us if you have any queries.



 Regards

 Shashwat (9884184060) and Advaith (9597346851)

  Rearrange the letters of 'nor do we' to get one word.
