Forest Gumps T-shirt

Body:
Dear friends,

We are planning to have a tshirt for our running club, Forest Gumps. The
design is available in the attached form. The material will be dryfit,
which is comfortable for long runs. They are expected to cost around Rs
300400 per tshirt. We will place the order once we have an estimate of
how many tshirts we want, and then get back to you with size and payment
details. Please do fill the attached form if you are interested!
