Date: July 28, 2016 (Thursday) Time: 10:00 AM Venue: Room 110, DoMS  Abstract: Financial development plays a crucial role in promoting investments by supplying credit and increasing the liquidity in the market. Similarly, financial openness also stimulates investments by providing foreign capital. Therefore, this study empirically explored the longrun association and causal impact of financial development and openness on the investments of the emerging market economies. The estimated results indicated that the financial openness and size of the financial sector had a longrun causal impact on the investments whereas the performance of the financial sector did not have any causal effect on investments. The result of the study helps the policy makers of the emerging nations in formulating policies for economic growth.
