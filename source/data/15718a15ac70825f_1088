Dear Prof. Kumar,

You may have received an email from us earlier. I=E2=80=99m writing to invi=
te
students of IIT Madras to take part in a global challenge for an
opportunity to send an experiment as payload to the Moon. The deadline
for entries is September 15th, 2016 and hence a request to share this
within the student community at the earliest. A quick intro to who we
are. TeamIndus is a young, passionate team of some of the best minds
in India, competing for the $30 million Google Lunar XPrize (GLXP) - a
global challenge to catalyze private enterprise in space exploration.
Among the leading contenders, we secured a $1 million milestone prize
from GLXP demonstrating our landing technology.

TeamIndus is building a spacecraft that will fly to the moon in late
2017 and we=E2=80=99ve announced a unique global challenge - Lab2Moon =E2=
=80=93 which
is an opportunity for students to create a project which would go to
the moon on board the spacecraft.

We believe that this is a great opportunity to drive interest in
science and technology =E2=80=93 especially space tech and innovation =E2=
=80=93 and
participation from students of IIT Madras will help showcase the
brightest young minds of your institution to India and the rest of the
world.

I would be grateful if you could share this opportunity with the
students of IIT Madras and others in your network.

To participate in Lab2Moon, youngsters under 25 years have to imagine,
design and build a project that will catalyze the evolution of mankind
as a sustainable multi-planetary species. TeamIndus believes that in
the future, mankind will not be bound only to earth and Lab2Moon will
look for experiments in sustainable living that will have benefits
both on earth and beyond. The best project, as decided by our judges,
will go to the moon aboard our spacecraft. What makes this opportunity
special is that this project could be part of the first non-government
payload to visit earth=E2=80=99s celestial neighbour since 1976.

Participation flow

Imagine and design a project that will help humans build a better
world on the moon.
Go to Lab2Moon.teamindus.in and register
Share a concept note and video on their project
Registration closes on 15th September, 2016 and 20 teams will be
shortlisted by the end of the month.
These teams will have over 4 months to build their prototype and
present it to our jury in February 2017. Teams will be flown to our
campus in Bangalore, India.

Our jury comprises eminent scientists from across the world:
- Dr. K. Kasturirangan, Former Chairman of Indian Space Research
Organisation
- Dr. Alain Bensoussan, Former President of CNES (French Space Agency)
and Former Chairman of the Council, European Space Agency
- Dr. Joe Pelton, Former Dean of International Space University
