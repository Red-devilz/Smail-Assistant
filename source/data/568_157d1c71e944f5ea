Dear Poojan,

According to the World Health Organization, trauma is the leading cause of
death and disability across the world. In fact, the WHO says, one person
dies on IndiaE2s roads every 5 minutes  a figure projected to rise 
to one
every 3 minutes by 2020! That is 360 deaths every day  equivalent to a
jumbo jet (A340/600) crashing. And while that would make people sit up and
take notice, the fact that more people die in road crashes than due to
malaria or TB, remains nothing more than a silent modern epidemic.

To this effect we request you to kindly hand this pledge to all students.


As IIT Madras student, On World Trauma Day, I solemnly pledge to:

 Be aware of and follow all traffic rules 

 Always wear a seatbelt or helmet when travelling

 Not use my mobile phone while driving or walking on roads

 Make way for an Ambulance instantly 

 Stop and offer help whenever there is an accident 
 Discourage drunk driving

Warm Regards,

Latha Venkitachalam
