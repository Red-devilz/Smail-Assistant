 Sir,

 I am Rahul Ramesh, currently a 3rd year Undergraduate from the Computer
 Science department. I am interested in taking the course : EE5154 :Complex
 Network Analysis offered in the even semester of 2017.  I would like to
 enquire if it would be possible for me to take this course as a free
 elective. I would also like to enquire regarding any required
 prerequisites for this course.

 Is it possible for me to meet you regarding the course? A preferred time
 for me would be on Tuesday afternoon owing to classes but any time as per
 your convenience should also do.
 Thank you for your time.


 Rahul Ramesh
