The vast majority,Awell over 90% of them, have no Computer Science degree. About 15% ofAour engineers do not have any degree at all, having come from ourAinhouse Zoho University program. Yet, Zoho is holding its own inAglobal competition, against the likes of Salesforce and Microsoft. InAthe highly contested global cloud market, Zoho has emerged as a strongAplayer, yet we have raised zero venture capital. Zoho challengesAconventional wisdom in many ways, and in my presentation I wouldAhighlight some specific insights that I have learned over the past 20Ayears, insights which form the foundation of this company. A couple ofAexamples would suffice, for those with a Computer Science bent: a)Asoftware project schedules are not computable b) most decisions youAface in business (and in life) are formally not decidable c) the mostAimportant aspects that define a company are not measurable.AAI would elaborate on these and other insights in my presentation. AA Biography: ASridhar Vembu is the founder and CEO of ZOHO Corporation (formerlyAAdventNet Inc). Zoho Corporation are the makers of the online ZohoAOffice Suite as well as several business applications.  Vembu holds aAPh.D. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University and aAB.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras.ADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD   rupesh.
