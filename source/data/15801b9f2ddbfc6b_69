Hey all,

Greetings from *Social Entrepreneurship Club and Team Involve,*

We are a team of enthusiastic IIT Madras students, headed towards bringing
a change in the current education status of the country. Through our
efforts, we are hoping to impact school going students.

*What do we do?*

Currently, we are working on the concept of *peer learning *and
implementing it on the primary and secondary school students to involve
them in learning and make it purpose based. We have already conducted a *pi=
lot
project (Proof of concept) during Summer 2016, in**A.S.N**. Sr. Secondary
School, Mayur **Vihar**, New Delhi*, and were quite successful in improving
the academics of students and establishing this concept of learning.

*What=E2=80=99s next?*

We are planning to do another project *here in Chennai*. This time we will
be focussing on the improvement of children living in the *rural/suburban
localities*, through the implementation of our model.

Therefore, we are looking for *enthusiastic, motivated volunteers* who are
passionate about education and are willing to work for this social cause.

*What work is expected from you?*

Our project will be divided into three phases, according to which following
work will be assigned to you as per your interests and abilities:

*Phase I (28th Oct - 10th Nov)*

During this period, we will be focussing mainly on data collection through
Surveys and Field Visits and identification of the communities, which need
us the most. The work mainly will be:

1.       Interacting with different rural/suburban communities in Chennai,
where potential students can be found.

2.       Conducting surveys in different schools and localities.

3.       Analysis of the collected data and documentation.

*Phase II (26th Nov - 18th Dec)*

During this period, we will be selecting student volunteers for our final
classroom program, as well as training and mentoring them for the project.
The work to be done in this phase will be:

1.       Content Improvement

2.       Class Coordination
