Reg: Reject null in favour of alternate
by MS15D022 SHARMISTHA DEY  Wednesday, 28 September 2016, 11:13 PM

Hello,C2A0

Ihave a doubt.

Todayduring tutorial key discussion we had a discussion about 'only reje
ct
the null' vs 'reject the null in favour of alternate'. And it came out that
when pvalue is low, we may reject the null but not always in favour of
alternate.

Ihave doubt here, lets assume H0: mu0Dmu1 and Ha: mu0<mu1, now the pv
alue
will only be low when it favours the alternate, otherwise it will be very
high since we are considering the right tail (check the below figure). Same
goes for mu0mu1, in this case we will consider the left tail and pvalue
will be low only when it favours the alternate. So my point is when pvalue
is small it always favours the alternate w.r.t null. And therefore whenever
we reject the null we always do that in favour of alternate. C2A0Otherwis
e we
just simply fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Ismy understanding correct or I am missing something?

[pvalue]
