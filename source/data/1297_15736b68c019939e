Subject:
Precautions against spread of mosquito related diseases

Body:
Dear All,
Mosquito borne diseases like Dengue and Chikungunya are prevalent
during the monsoon season.
The ideal way to prevent this disease from spreading is to observe
certain precautions.

All of us know that stagnant fresh water is a breeding ground for such
mosquitoes.  Can we help each other spot such places and prevent the
breeding.  We can either close them or empty them on our own.  If you
have difficulty, you can always inform the security (2257 9999) who
will be able to help.

Let us do this on a war footing and prevent each other from suffering.
Please use all means to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes.

anbudan,
Siva
