Re: Gangasters BUDGET

Body:
You can always suggest sensor kits or eextronic modules which you need in
hostel and we will try to make it available for you. The factors of
consideration will be:
1) Useful for the hostel/its application part
2) Having similar budget as compared to individual sensors

Actually this is the best way that you keep suggesting the things according
to the budget and the best one will be selected.

 For the Tech part, why not get a sensor kit which includes Ultrasonic,
 Proximity, etc.?. Also, can't we get RFID or Bluetooth modules as well?
 Although they might not be useful for TechSoc, they're still fairly common
 components for IoT related stuff.

 Please look into it if you missed the GBM by any chance and suggest
 changes.
 Have a good day!
