Subject:
Diwali and Fireworks - We can lead the way

Body:
b'       It is young people like you that have decidedto quell thisnotion and make a statement to the world that enjoying a Hindu festival like Diwali can happen without scaring or hurting animals, polluting this beautiful campus, endangering human life sometimes and perhaps, aiding child labor! Bravo!       Let the Students of IIT Madras show the world they care!  I request you to think of the animals, to think of the environment, and to especially think of those young children who are forced into child labor simply so that we can have a few moments of pleasure.  World looks up to an IITian. By avoiding fireworks as much as possible, IIT Madras students can lead the world in conveying that there are many beautiful and fun filled ways of celebrating Diwali without causing harm to people, animals and the environment. Let everyone know that we can make a difference to th is  world.   After all, we are Engineers who stand for creation and not destruction.             Anbudan,    Siva (Sivakumar Srinivasan)    Dean (Students)  IIT Madras.  (+91 94440 08050)     '
