 About SLC:
 The Student Legislative Council (SLC) is the student body of the
 Institute which functions as the central policy making body of the
 Institute and formulates its policies based on the demands and aspiratio
ns
 of the General Student Body (GSB). Crudely put, the SLC is like the stud
ent
 parliament of the institute.

 SLC is also about students solving their problems by making decisions
 for themselves in a responsible manner and standing up for each other in
 solidarity. Unity, hence, is important.

 It is a way for us to become better citizens of tomorrow.

 Democracy of the students, by the students, and for the students is what
 SLC stands for.
