Abstract: 

TCP-based bandwidth allocation to individual flows contending for
bandwidth on bottleneck links has served the Internet well for
decades. However, this model of bandwidth allocation assumes all flows
are of equal priority and that all flows benefit equally from any
incremental share of available bandwidth, which is not necessarily
true for distributed computing running across a private WAN. In
addition, WAN bandwidth is a constrained resource that is economically
infeasible to substantially over provision. In order to efficiently
utilize network resources within and across data centers, we present
the Bandwidth Enforcer (BwE), a WAN bandwidth allocation mechanism
that provides work-conserving bandwidth allocation, hierarchical
fairness with flexible policy among competing services, and achievable
Service Level Objective (SLO) targets that independently account for
bandwidth, latency, and loss.
