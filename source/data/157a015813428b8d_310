Greetings from NSS
Hello everyone
  We hope that the first Wintern Orientation session helped you gain an  
insight into what Winterns are. We would now like to know if you would be  
interested in attending the Winterns.  Students who are involved in  
projects which conduct their own Winterns are advised to opt for Project  
Winterns alone.  ( Note; this is just a preliminary form for gauging your  
interests. However, do fill it up sincerely)

The deadline for filling is 12 pm, Monday, 10th October.

In case of any queries, please email us at nss@iitm.ac.in

Thanks and regards
NSS Managerial Team
