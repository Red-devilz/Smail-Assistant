Dear mentors,
I'm a software developer and I'm new around here. I wish to contribute to your codebase. Can someone help me get started?
Thank you.

So, Python as far as Google Summer of Code goes is a *lot* of different 
code bases.  20+ in fact.  So you'll need to narrow down your question a 
bit before anyone can even start to answer you!

You can see who participated last year here:
https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2016

But there's no guarantee that all those groups will participate again in 
2017.  Many groups won't be making that decision for sure until January 
or February of 2017 when they know which mentors will be available.  But 
that's ok, any experience will help you be a better candidate for GSoC, 
so if that's your goal it doesn't matter which group you choose first.


If you're overwhelmed with the choices, you might want to read this to 
help you get started:

https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#How_do_I_choose_a_project_or_a_sub-org.3F

Good luck!

  Terri
