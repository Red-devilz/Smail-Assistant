ABSTRACT :	=

	=

Skin cancer is one of the pressing health care issues worldwide with millio=
ns of new cases being diagnosed each year. Optical technologies are becomin=
g increasingly important in the clinical management of skin cancer as they =
can play key roles in cancer screening, diagnosis, staging, and monitoring =
response to treatment. These techniques could offer the potential for fast,=
 convenient, non-invasive early detection providing a valuable aid to the c=
linician and increased comfort to the patient. The work presented here aims=
 to build on a bimodal spectroscopic system for assessment of non melanoma =
skin cancer non-invasively with the help of biologically relevant biomarker=
s in different layers of skin. Fluorescence and diffuse reflectance are the=
 two modalities of interest in this work and were implemented in their sing=
le point spectroscopic and imaging configurations. The spectroscopic probe =
system was employed to study the changes associated with the progression of=
 non melanoma skin cancer by the use of realistic layered tissue equivalent=
 phantoms mimicking the normal and diseased conditions. We have focused our=
 attention on different prominent biomarkers specific to skin cancer such a=
s tissue metabolism reflected by FAD (Flavin adenine dinucleotide) content,=
 tissue oxygenation / hemoglobin concentration as well as collagen content =
in the tissue.  In the first modality, the spectroscopic system is used in =
its reflectance mode to study the variations in hemoglobin concentrations a=
nd tissue oxygenation associated with normal and diseased conditions. In th=
e second study, we have carried out FAD and collagen fluorescence measureme=
nts on bilayered tissue phantoms of varying compositions resembling conditi=
ons associated with non melanoma skin cancer. In the final study, the setup=
 was integrated with a scanning stage for imaging the diffuse reflectance a=
nd fluorescence from skin phantoms representing normal and diseased tissues=
. Our experimental results combined with simulations demonstrated earlier s=
uggest that the remarkable variation of optical properties of biomarkers de=
rived from the methodology could help in identifying the extent of the dise=
ase which could be used for future in-vivo clinical applications.
