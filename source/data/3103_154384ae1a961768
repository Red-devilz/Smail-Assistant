[Seminars] CSE: Research Proposal Seminar: May 4 at 10:00 in BSB 361.

Body:
b'     Hello,    Here is an announcement of a research proposal seminar.    Student: Jyothi Krishna V S (CS13D022)  Date: May 4, 2016  Time: 10:00  Venue: BSB 361    Subject:  Compiler Enhanced Scheduling for OpenMP for Heterogeneous Multiprocessors    Abstract :  Scheduling in Asymmetric Multicore Processors(AMP), a special case of Heterogeneous Multiprocessors, is a widely studied topic. The scheduling techniques which are mostly runtime do not usually consider parallel programming pattern used in parallel programming frameworks like OpenMP. The current compilers for these parallel programming plat forms are hardware oblivious which prevent any compile time optimization for platforms like big.LITTLE and has to completely rely on runtime optimization. In this paper we propose a Hardware aware Compiler Enhanced Scheduling (CES) where common compiler transformations are coupled with compiler added scheduling commands to take advan tage of the hardware asymmetry and improve the runtime efficiency. We implement a compiler for OpenMP and demonstrate its efficiency in Samsung Exynos with big.LITTLE ar chitecture. On an average we see 18% reduction in runtime and 14% reduction in energy consumption in standard NPB and FSU benchmarks with CES across multiple frequencies and core configurations in big.LITTLE.    rupesh.
