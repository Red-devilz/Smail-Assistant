Hello everyone,

As part of IViL's Library Project, we are conducting a donation drive for
used books this weekend (9th and 10th April).

A box will be placed at the security desk of every hostel from 9am to 8pm
on both days. Please neatly place your used books (in usable condition) in
the boxes.

You can also hand them over to NSS volunteers as part of the NSS
Collection Drive.

Please find below a list of the categories of books we are looking for:

1. Preparatory books for TNSPC, Bank Exams etc
2. English Grammar and Spoken English Resources
3. General Knowledge and current affairs
4. Logical Reasoning.
5. Basic English and Mathematics books
6.. Motivational books
7.Autobiographies/Biographies (in Tamil preferably)
8. Kids Science Experiments/puzzles
9. Science magazines
10. Novels and story books
11. Civil Preparation material
12. JEE Books
13. Educational multimedia resources ( CD's etc.)


About the Library Project: started by IViL last semester as a means of
bridging the knowledge gap between rural and urban areas in India. As part
of the project, we have identified a village in Veppampattu (Tiruvallur
district), where we would be setting up a library and supporting 2 other
resource centers already running in the village. Working with interested
young volunteers in the village, we have obtained permissions and a small
building from the village Panchayat to set up a library inside the village.

For queries, please mail IViL or contact me at 9790464091.


Warm regards,

Ajit Raghavendra
