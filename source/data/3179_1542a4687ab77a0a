 @Gensec I think that's a bad idea that you should stay far far away from.
 Especially with the levels of inaction on the parts of secretaries this
 year, having a moderated group will suppress people's ability to express
 opinions and frequent concerns on usual issues. It's a bad policy to have
 potential moderators who would be in no hurry to approve inconvenient mai
ls.

 If we as true gangasters are truly as great as we claim to be, i think we
 should take passing criticism of our music less seriously. :P Since anywa
y
 the matter is not totally in our hands, might as well live happy lives an
d
 do what we can while we can. I love our hostel to a reasonable extent and
 like to see it win, but i'm not sure how reasonable it is to expect the
 same sentiment out of everybody. It is going to be just a hostel for some
.
 Getting angry with people who aren't as attached to Ganga as you will onl
y
 pain you more, and as some of our fellow gangasters will confirm, there a
re
 far more effective ways of paining oneself on a regular basis. :P

 Chill out, guys!!

 Cheers,
 Samir.

 Hi!

 Just to strike a balanced note here. Let's all be nice and courteous and
 not indulge in personal attacks. It's wrong for anyone to be thrown out 
of
 this group (though I really understand the emotions behind the demand).

 Let him tell that for him, Ganga is just a hostel. We will show him that
 for us, all students living in Ganga are Gangasters and are one of our o
wn,
 and that despite what arguments we have amongst each other, we will care
 for all. Please do not throw anyone outside this group. All of us are
 better than that  we needn't stoop that low.

 Hi,

 Sorry guys, I don't intend to spam this thread but this is too muc
h.

 As the hostel who has consistently placed in the top positions in
 all music competitions and with highly qualified members (Who don'
t need
 certificates to prove their credibility, since they're actually ge
tting
 paid to pursue music), we sincerely apologize for helping Ganga wi
n all
 sorts of competitions with our "poor skills in music". As a socal
led
 musician yourself, I didn't expect that one could go so low and pe
rsonal in
 some issue like this, which can be settled peacefully (Which we ha
ve tried,
 but to no avail, as you can see). We are being diplomatic and poli
te
 (Trying to respect someone older and more experienced than us) and
 you
 throw replies at us such as "Just to prove that my claim is not as
 hollow as your head I have sent one of my certificates to your per
sonal
 mail. Now, you may suck that rat's posterior or frontal part as yo
u
 prefer." Being someone senior to us, we expected someone more matu
re. But
 no, that isn't the case.

 Anyway, we'll stop playing our "terrible music" by Sunday, so you
 can peacefully study then or do whatever it is that you do. Hence,
 I
 request you to please stop spamming this group with more thinly ve
iled
 personal insults at someone you don't know and can't appreciate. T
hank you
 so much for adjusting with us, it's really generous of you!

 I hope that this issue is settled now. You could talk to us
 personally (We'll be in the music room!) if we're again irritating
 you, and
 we'll try our best not to. Thanks!

 +1 to Ravi. Even I never heard of such issues being raised.

 I have no connection into music but their's was pretty decent
 to hear. Their volume level was pretty reasonable and you can'
t ask them to
 play music like murmuring. If someone is very good at music, w
hy can't you
 just participate in the hostel team? Or atleast guide them to 
play
 properly? Openly criticizing says that you have no feel for ho
stel at all,
 try encouraging man. You need not cheer all the way during the
ir
 participation, atleast adjust for very few days.

 @Rakesh Vakr, All the hostels participate and hence practice.
 Hence changing hostel might not help him. Probably he should s
tay outside
 campus himself without any authorities involving.

 If Ganga is nothing to you more than a hostel, your
 certificates are nothing more than a paper.

 @arjunar Thanks for your opinion, but I assure you we do not
 give a rat's posterior end about it. We're pretty convinced t
he issue isn't
 with our music, par Kanpur mein kuch problem hai. I call bluf

 claims of you being a musician yourself, because a true music
ian wouldn't
 berate another's efforts. I maintain that you're either tone
deaf or that
 you are hallucinating the "music that sucks".
 The world does not revolve around you, and certainly, neither
 does Ganga hostel.

 This direct offensive assault on the quality of the Ganga
 music team is really depressing, as we want the hostel member
s to be one
 big united family (not that we are taking it one bit seriousl
y). You really
 do not seem to fit in here. Instead of all of us going elsewh
ere, why don't
 you request for a change of hostel? That's a more feasible so
lution, and a
 winwin situation for us.

 Thanks, don't come again
