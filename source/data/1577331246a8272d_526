*Tata Steel Advanced Materials Research Center now at IIT Madras
*
Tata Steel signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Indian=20
Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) on August 16, 2016 to set up=20
the Tata Steel Advanced Materials Research Center (TSAMRC) at IIT Madras=20
Research Park. This initiative comes in the light of Tata Steel being=20
entrusted with the responsibility of developing a long-term strategic=20
roadmap in the area of advanced materials.

Over the last few decades, new materials have been engineered by=20
research laboratories worldwide. These materials, often termed=20
"advanced" materials, provide unique combinations of physical and=20
chemical properties that were either absent or difficult to obtain using=20
conventional materials.

Speaking at the occasion, Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director IIT Madras,=20
said, =E2=80=9DIIT Madras and Tata Steel will be working closely together t=
o=20
come up with new materials, which will include but not restricted to=20
graphene, that will have new applications. We hope to discover many=20
innovative materials together and hope that in few years TSAMRC will be=20
noticed globally. IIT Madras has world standard faculty, students and=20
equipment that can provide the next breakthrough in creating=20
applications with new materials. The Research Park at IIT Madras=20
provides one of the best ecosystems for collaborative research=E2=80=9D.

Mr. Anand Sen, President (Total Quality Management and Steel Business),=20
Tata Steel Limited added by saying, =E2=80=9CTata Steel has been collaborat=
ing=20
extensively with IIT Madras since the last many years, especially in=20
materials characterization, heat transfer and process research. TSAMRC=20
marks a new chapter in this journey and opens up the frontier in=20
advanced materials synthesis, design and solutions=E2=80=9D.

*International Conference on Financial Markets and Corporate Finance 2016 *
