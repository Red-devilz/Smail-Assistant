Hey all!!

We are taking a short survey for the foreign languages most commonly known  
by students who are applying for internships through Summer Internship  
Program 2017, IIT Madras.  It is of immense help to our Internship Team to  
reach out to foreign firms/companies. For example, you may know French,  
Spanish, Japanese, etc., I urge everyone who are yet to avail internship to  
fill out the form.

Best Regards
Pavithra Moorthy
Internship Coordinator, 2016
