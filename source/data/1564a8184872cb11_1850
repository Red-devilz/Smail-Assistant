*Students other than first years, please ignore this e-mail.*

A warm welcome to all freshers!

I hope to see all of you at the *Sports Orientation* to be held on *Thursday,
4th August* in *SAC (Middle-Earth) *at *6 PM*. We will have a brief
presentation about sports at IITM, NSO and the Inter IIT Sports Meet. Our
institute sport captains will also be there to answer any queries you might
have.

Do attend, as we will be having a give-away where you stand a chance to win
Inter IIT memorabilia. It has never been easier to get involved with
sports; seize the moment!

Thank you!

Best regards,
