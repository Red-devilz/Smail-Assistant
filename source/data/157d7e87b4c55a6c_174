Hello everyone,

This is a gentle reminder for the lecture tomorrow.

Have a look at the summary of the lecture in the email above and also the
bio of the speaker for more information. Even though quizzes are going on,
I am sure those who are interested in the topics mentioned will find the
lecture interesting. We get privilege of listening to lectures like this on
rare occasions. I hope you will be able to make most out of it!


Thanks and Regards,
