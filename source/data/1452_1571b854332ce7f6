Are you guys aware of this opportunity?  I was familiar with Team Indus
work before and have worked with Rahul Narayan, its CEO before, and it
looks like they are working on an extended time line.  They were planning
to throw open this competition, and it seems they are finally at it.

WhatE2s the best way to disseminate this to interested students?

best,
Satya

Dear Prof. Chakravarthy,

You may have received an email from us earlier. IE2m writing to invi
te
students of IIT Madras to take part in a global challenge for an
opportunity to send an experiment as payload to the Moon. The deadline for
entries is September 15th, 2016 and hence a request to share this within
the student community at the earliest. A quick intro to who we
are. TeamIndus is a young, passionate team of some of the best minds in
India, competing for the $30 million Google Lunar XPrize (GLXP)  a global
challenge to catalyze private enterprise in space exploration. Among the
leading contenders, we secured a $1 million milestone prize from GLXP
demonstrating our landing technology.

TeamIndus is building a spacecraft that will fly to the moon in late 2017
and weE2ve announced a unique global challenge  Lab2Moon E2 
which is an
opportunity for students to create a project which would go to the moon on
board the spacecraft.

We believe that this is a great opportunity to drive interest in science
and technology E2 especially space tech and innovation E2 and
 participation
from students of IIT Madras will help showcase the brightest young minds of
your institution to India and the rest of the world.

I would be grateful if you could share this opportunity with the students
of IIT Madras and others in your network.

To participate in Lab2Moon, youngsters under 25 years have to imagine,
design and build a project that will catalyze the evolution of mankind as a
sustainable multiplanetary species. TeamIndus believes that in the future,
mankind will not be bound only to earth and Lab2Moon will look for
experiments in sustainable living that will have benefits both on earth and
beyond. The best project, as decided by our judges, will go to the moon
aboard our spacecraft. What makes this opportunity special is that this
project could be part of the first nongovernment payload to visit earthE2
s
celestial neighbour since 1976.

Participation flow

   world on the moon.
