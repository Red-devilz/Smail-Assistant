Body:
All matches will be held on Saturday.

The fixtures can be found here
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDSdiL23-JrwaeFAIuiruaUC19oQfHXmR6Mh6BUVyWc/edit#gid=0>.
All Round 1 and Round 2 matches shall happen before lunch.

I've already informed the Round 1 teams and since we have 9 teams who've
registered, only two of them have the first round. Everyone else has
progressed to the second round. Round 2 matches will start at 10. The
tentative time of commencement of the other matches has been put on the
sheet. Please be on time.

Regards
