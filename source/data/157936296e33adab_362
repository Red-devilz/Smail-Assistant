Hey All !

Greetings from The *Centre for Innovation *

What's the one tool that all coding-enthusiasts use, be it data analysts,
web developers, hackers, or researchers in all fields varying from
Biotechnology to Computer Vision  to Machine Learning have in common?

You guessed it. *Python*.

We at the Centre for Innovation feel it is absolutely necessary for
everyone to know at least the basics of Python, no matter which branch you
belong to and which club interests you. To meet that requirement, we are
conducting an *Introduction to Python* session on the *6th* of this month.
The session is open to students of all years, not just freshers.

Laptops, though not required, are recommended so that you can code along
with us. We begin at 6:00pm *sharp*. If you have a laptop, make sure you
have the latest version of Anaconda Python installed before you come (

Date, Time and Place: *6th of October*, from *6:00pm to 8:00pm* at *ESB
127,128*


Cheers!
