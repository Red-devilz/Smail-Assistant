At this moment, I would like express my deep sense of gratitude for bestowing the trust upon me to serve the institute, and it was indeed a privilege.     I would also like to thank you all for the help, support, and patience you all have extended to the Gymkhana office over these years. The role of Advisor (Sports) has largely contributed in my professional and personal development, and has allowed me to make a sincere attempt to contribute substantially for the improvement of the Institute Gymkhana and sports facilities. Such a contribution and improvement would not have been achieved without the support and timely guidance given by many of you. I would like to acknowledge the support from our outstanding administrators, faculty colleagues, staff, students, our alumni, and wonderful campus community. I would specially like to thank for the support from Institute Engineering unit and Gymkhana Staff members.     Over these years, my association with Gymkhana has given me lot of good memories, which I will cherish for years to come.    I truly believe that Prof. Santhosh is an excellent choice based on his experience and administrative expertise. I am confident that he will take Institute Gymkhana to the next level of excellence. I request and hope he will also be extended full support and help from all of you, which I experienced during my tenure. I wish him all the best.
