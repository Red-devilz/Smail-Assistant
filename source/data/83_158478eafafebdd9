Litsoc Writing Avial - Writing Avial || November 9 (Today) || 5.30 PM

Body:
Attention minstrels, vagabonds, o riders of this weary raft!

Turn up today at 5:30 pm to HSB 334 to Writing Club's second and last
Litsoc event of the sem   a Writing Avial! Outside of the Mallu band,
avial is a dish that was apparently invented by Bheem to not waste
vegetables left over from the marriage of the Pandavas. Bunch of stuff
thrown into a pot to make a heady brewbroth.

So what you will find yourself doing is in teams of two attempt five fun
short writing events. Rhymed and nonrhymed poetry, short fiction, amoeba
and paired writing funzies, which we like to call yinyang, on offer.
Come off, turn up, arrivo scenarium, take fun and the ob Litsoc points on a
closely contested table! Don't let Sharav thulp this writing event as well,
gather in large numbers, men, we have nothing to lose but our chains.

Date: November 9, TODAY
Time: 5:30 pm, THIS EVENING
Venue: HSB 344

Maximum of three teams of two per hostel. Event will begin as soon as
possible as it is a long event. All teams must be present at the beginning
(5:30 pm, that is) and cannot join in between as it happens in three
stages/sets.

Zainab and Achraj,

Writing Club Coordinators 201617.
