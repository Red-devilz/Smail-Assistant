Gangasters No water in big near 464

Body:
Respected hostelmen

The water in the bog adjacent to room number 464 has been stopped/isn't
there for the last 4 days.
The issue has been brought to the notice of the hostel office on the very
1st day. Also the Gen Sec has been personally informed about the same.
This bog houses a washing machine which lays impotent because of this lack
of availability of water supply to it.
Hence we the people of Ganga Hostel and especially the top floor dwellers
request the GS to sort out the said issue. Reading a separate thread give a
me the impression that the HHS doesn't care about us underprivileged top
floor boarders, though I wouldn't mind reconsidering my opinion given
further evidence. Hence the GS is expected to do this as a parting favour
so as to not earn the disappointment of us top floor tenents.

Thanking you

Regards
Aarkesh

PS  Writing a HS paper taught me how to complicate a simple issue good
fixing the bog and hence I wanted to share my agony with you all.
