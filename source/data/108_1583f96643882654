Body:
Sir,

I am Rahul Ramesh, currently a 3rd year Undergraduate from the Computer 
Science department. I am interested in taking the course : EE5154 
:Complex Network Analysis offered in the even semester of 2017.  I 
would like to enquire if it would be possible for me to take this 
course as a free elective. I would also like to enquire regarding any 
required prerequisites for this course.

Is it possible for me to meet you regarding the course? A preferred 
time for me would be on Tuesday afternoon owing to classes but any time 
as per your convenience should also do.
Thank you for your time.


Rahul Ramesh
