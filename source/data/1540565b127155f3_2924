Dear All,

You are welcome to the Algebra Seminar this week:

Speaker: Jyoti Dasgupta, Research Scholar, Dept of Mathematics, IITM.

Title: Affine monoids and their Hilbert bases - III.

Date & Time: 12 April (Tuesday) 2016, 3:00pm.

Venue: Madhava Hall (HSB 357)


Abstract: In this series of talks we will discuss Affine monoids and 
their Hilbert bases, from  the book Polytopes, Rings and K-theory by 
Bruns and Gubeladze. Affine monoids are the basic structure with the 
help of which we form monoid algebras - the main tool in the study of 
interactions between discrete geometry, commutative ring theory and 
algebraic K-theory. In this talk we will discuss standard mapping of 
affine monoids and Hilbert bases.

With best regards,
--
