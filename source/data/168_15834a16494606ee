Gangasters Re: Unavailability of Badminton Racquets

Body:
Hello!

The badminton racquets have been repaired and are placed at the watchman's
desk.

Also, a lot of people were asking for a Squash Racquet. There is a new one
available at the watchman's desk. Please use it very judiciously. It is
quite expensive and we do not have enough budget for another squash racquet.

Also, whoever has the RNS cricket bat, please return it to the watchman's
desk asap.

Thanks
Kaushik

 The badminton racquets have been given for repair. Hence, they will not be
 available at the watchman's desk. We'll get them back in proper shape in a
 couple of days. Sorry for the inconvenience.
