Gangasters Dean`s Trophy-Powelifting

Body:
Hii Guys,
            Anyone who is interested to participate in powerlifting on sunday
(10042016) can contact me(Naresh8680076841) or Mahesh (9092477101) or
Bikram(8695502915).

Don`t think that you don`t know any techniques, because it is not about the
techniques, it`s about your strength.

Remember that we have a practice session on thursday (07042016) at 6 pm.

 
Regards,
Naresh Naik D

Powerlifting Captain,
