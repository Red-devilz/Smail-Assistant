Hello all! Greetings from *C**FI*

Greetings from Horizon, The Physics and Astronomy club of IIT Madras!
We hope the semester began well for everyone. We are back to observation
now, with an observation session on the Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus.

Not explaining the jargon, the bottom line is one can see Venus and Jupiter
within 0.5=C2=B0 of each other, which means we should be able to get them b=
oth
in the same field of view! For the stargazers, we have some more info here
<http://www.space.com/33792-venus-jupiter-conjunction.html>.

So *When?*: 27th August 2016 (Saturday)
But *Where?*: HSB Rooftop
At *What time?*: 6.30 p.m

The rooftop is accessible to students through the stairs opposite to the UG
Physics lab. We will try to capture the planets in the same field, so do
get your cameras!

We will be having an informal orientation during the observation session
for the *Freshers*. So do attend if you don't have any plans of
Saturday-evening
outing!

*Note:* The sky has been bad off late, and there has been a huge cloud
cover. So do keep checking our Fb page
