Assignment #2
by KRISHNA NANDIVADA V (CS)  Thursday, 29 September 2016, 6:12 AM

Dear Students,

Iwas preparing the questions for Assignment#2 and realized that it is
probably better (from the point of view of amount of portion covered) if we
release A#2 after a month. There is one more option: divide the assignment
into two parts and release one part now (with a deadline in around 7 days)
and second part after a month (with a deadline in around 7 days).

Remindme to discuss about it in the class today.

Krishna.
