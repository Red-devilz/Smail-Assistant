ABSTRACT :	=


This study was aimed at developing a method for automatically selecting few=
 representative frames from several hundreds of Axial Shear Strain Elastogr=
am (ASSE) frames typically obtained during freehand compression elastograph=
y of breast in vivo. This may also alleviate some inter-observer variation =
that arises at least partly due to the differences in selection of represen=
tative frames from a cine-loop for evaluation and feature extraction. In ad=
dition to correlation coefficient and frame-average axial strain (FAAS) tha=
t have been previously used as a quality indicator for axial strain elastog=
rams (ASE), we incorporated the angle of compression that has unique effect=
s on ASSE interpretation. These identified quality factors were computed fo=
r every frame in the Elastographic cine-loop. In order to avoid any random,=
 isolated, frame that may happen to get selected due to its superior image =
quality, but does not provide visual continuity, the proposed 2-step algori=
thm identifies a section of contiguous frames in the cine-loop that is comp=
uted to be of good quality. In the first step, the algorithm identifies fiv=
e non-overlapping sections of N contiguous frames (N=3D10) form the cine-lo=
op that posses highest cumulative quality scores. In the next step, the sec=
tion with highest cumulative contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was selected as =
the final representative section. A total of 40 biopsy-proven malignant or =
benign in-vivo breast data were part of this study. The performance of the =
automated algorithm was evaluated by comparing its selection against the on=
es selected by the trained radiologists. To accomplish this, two radiologis=
t-observers visually identified a representative frame after viewing entire=
 elastographic cine-loop. The observer identified frame that consisted of S=
onogram, ASE, and ASSE was compared with the respective images in the frame=
s of the algorithm-identified section using cross-correlation as a similari=
ty measure. It was observed that there was on an average 82%, 83% and 78% c=
orrelation between corresponding Sonogram, ASE and ASSE of the observer- se=
lected and the algorithm-selected frames, respectively. The results demonst=
rate that automatic frame selection method described here may provide an ob=
jective way to select a representative frame while saving time for a radiol=
ogist. Furthermore, the frame quality metric described and used here can be=
 displayed in real-time as a feedback to guide elastographic data acquisiti=
on and for training purposes.
