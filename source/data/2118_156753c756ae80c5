Change in schedule
by CS12B060 SAHIL SHARMA  Wednesday, 10 August 2016, 9:37 PM

It was pointed out that 16 september (Friday) is Monday's time table. The
schedule has been changed accordingly. Please refer to the same spreadsheet
for the changes. SEPTEMBER 2 (which was supposed to be a noclass day
because of quiz 1) is now a normal ML class day. September 16 is a ML
HOLIDAY (Since it's MONDAY;S TIMETABLE).
