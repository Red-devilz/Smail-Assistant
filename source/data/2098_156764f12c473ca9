Hi,

Ihave two questions,

Q1.C2A0For problem 3a, XY will not be a geometric distribution also I am 
not
able to find a closed form solution for P(XY) since it is coming to an
infinite series with a^(1/n) . Should this be XY or I am doing something
wrong?

Q2.For problem 6, will the trials stop once the criterion of at least n
successes and/or at least m failure satisfies, or the trials will continue
till a predefined number (let's say k) is met?

Thanks

C2A0
