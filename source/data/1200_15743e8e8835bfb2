 Hey!

 The Sports Organising Committee is conducting an online competition for
 each hostel. Our slot is on the 20th of this month (Tuesday). Please go
 like the IIT Madras Sports page (link provided here
 ) on that day.

 Each hostel has been allotted a specified day. So, do not like the page
 on any other day as this shall increase their count of likes. The hostel
 that manages to generate the maximum amount of increase in likes shall get
 a 7.5K discount on sports equipment. This is a big amount and can help us
 buy quality sports goods.

 So, please make sure you go like the page on Tuesday!

 Thank you

 Regards
 Kaushik
