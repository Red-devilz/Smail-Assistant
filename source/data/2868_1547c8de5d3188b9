Whatever to be decided, it should be decided by tomorrow itself. M.Sc.
(Maths) students  are leaving on 6th.

BTW, Common Room is a bad idea.

 I can't find any reason for denying the 3:1 system. Naveen, please talk to
 the warden/CCW and get it confirmed.

 The argument is simple

 There are valuable stuff which if put in common room are sure to get
 damaged/stolen. If ccw is ready to take responsibility for them, then it's
 okay.
 Which obviously they won't.

 Alternative to that, would be dump rooms on a wing basis,where we would be
 held responsible for our stuff.

 Please convey this to the concerned authorities and get back to us . It is
 sad that our campus junta are being asked to take pain for outsiders .

 We need budget for cartoon boxes and I will get my budget in next sem
 only. Puneeths remaining budget won't be sufficient for that.

 Hi,



 Has this system been decided because the rooms are going to be painted in
 the summer? Did CCW give you a reason for not giving one room for every 3
 rooms and instead giving a the common rooms for dumping? Please clarify.
 Also giving carton boxes is important from the manifesto point of
 view(which actually no one cares about)

 I guess punit might be having some money remaining.

 Ask him once. I dont think so the warden should say no for cartons as they
 ensure a better safety of our belongings
