Greetings,

The Accessibility Summit Team, Shaastra 2017 brings to you,

Hackathon for the Visually Impaired

India=E2=80=99s first ever blind hackathon.


A hackathon is an event where people gather and build programs together.
The Hackathon for the Visually Impaired will be an event for the visually
challenged to build programs which improve our lives and the world.

To bring out the best from our participants, and to make the visually
challenged more employable, independent and self-sufficient, Shaastra, in
collaboration with Vision-Aid <http://www.visionaidindia.org/index.html>,
is conducting a Programming Course for the Visually Impaired.


Python Programming For the Visually Impaired


What?


This is an introductory level course in Python programming for the visually
challenged. The goal of the program is to help students with no prior
exposure to computer science to learn to think computationally and write
programs to tackle useful problems. The course is based on MIT=E2=80=99s on=
line
course, is made with the help of MIT=E2=80=99s professors and will be taugh=
t by an
IIT Madras alumnus living in Massachusetts.
