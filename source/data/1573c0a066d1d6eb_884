Body:
This mail is in regard to the couple of questions you had asked us to 
answer online.

1) Where is boot_alloc called?

Boot alloc is called for :
	*   Creating Page directory
	*   Creating Struct Page_info (of size = npages * sizeof(Page_info)
	*    Called as boot_alloc(0) in order to find out the current point 
upto which memory is allocated by boot_alloc. This is required since 
when we do page_init(), we need skip used pages, and using 
boot_alloc(0), we can find the next unused point and skip the hole.

2) Where are Page2Pa and Page2kva used in the code?

*  Page2pa is used in PgdirWalk. This is because, if a new page is 
created(for new page table), then the page table entry must be filled 
with an entry pointing to the corresponding page physical address. 
Hence we get a new page from the page free list and find its  physical 
address using page2pa which is used to fill the page table entry. 
Page2pa is used for a similar reason in page_insert()

*  Page2kva is used in page_alloc() where a physical page is 
allocated(obtained from the free list). When we are required to clear 
the entire page and set all bytes in the page to zero, we use memset(). 
However memset requires the virtual address of the page, which is found 
using page2kva.
