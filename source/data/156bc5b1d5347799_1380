learn to solve the types of problems that we ask as part of the Google APAC
2017 University Test <https://code.google.com/codejam/apactest>. For many,
they haven't had the exposure. To help, we are hosting an information
session tomorrow at 7pm. Requesting you to kindly circulate the below note
to your students.
