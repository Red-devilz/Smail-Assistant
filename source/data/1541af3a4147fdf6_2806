1. Volume was *not* lowered on request for three days. Each day they told
that they would reduce the volume but they didn't.
2. I love music. In fact, I learned tabla and other percussion instruments
for 10 years and had 2 state level participations, But as I mentioned
before, your music sucks. Try practicing somewhere else or at least get the
room sound proof.
