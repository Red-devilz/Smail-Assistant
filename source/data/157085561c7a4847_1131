Dear all,

We would like to resume Ball Badminton practice in our campus. For this, we
require all the Ball Badminton enthusiasts to fill this form
<https://goo.gl/forms/y3PMF88IQdm0b6Tn2>.

We are planning to hire a coach depending on the interest shown by the
students and an inter-hostel tournament will also be conducted during this
academic year.

Thank you!

Best regards,
