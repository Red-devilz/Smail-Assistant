Subject:
[Seminars] Hydrology and Climate Change Impacts Across Scales by
	Dr.Venkat Sridhar from Virginia Tech.

Body:
b'   Dear Colleagues,  We would like to invite you to a talk on  "Hydrology and Climate Change Impacts Across Scales" by Dr.Venkat Sridhar from Virginia Tech.   Venue:  EWRE Seminar hall   Date and Time:  March 9, 2016 (Wednesday) at 4:30PM   Summary:  Ensuring adequate supply and quality of water is critical to meet both increasing human and ecosystem needs impacted by climate variability and change in the 21st century. The availability, quality, and timing of water is also severely threatened due to a general intensification of the hydrologic cycle (precipitation, evaporation, streamflow, recharge) caused by climate and land cover/ land use changes, as well as increasing water demand around the globe. Climate change will make water resources planning management based on historic climate conditions less reliable in the future. A few selected river basins in Idaho that encompass a contrasting environment for the hydrologic assessment viz. managed/natural, surface/ground water interaction, agricultural/forested ecosystem will be presented.   All are invited.  Kind regards Indu and Balaji     ABalaji Narasimhan, PhDA.  &#'
