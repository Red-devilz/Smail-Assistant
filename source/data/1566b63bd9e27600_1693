About Hapkido
Hapkido is a Korean martial art, which translates as "Coordinated energy
method". Hapkido is classified as a "soft" martial art because it focuses
on using opponent's energy against them. It is a comprehensive martial art,
and includes very diverse techniques such as kicks, strikes, rolls, falls,
throws, grappling, joint locks and the use of weapons.

Benefits: Consistent and focused exercise prepares us for a long and
quality life. Studies have shown that physical exercises that work on
balance allow us to maintain our muscle tone and bone density well in to
our 80's. In addition to fitness, it offers so much more, including
self-defense, stress relief, discipline, socialization and feelings of
accomplishment. The stress relief that comes with exercise and martial arts
training help you maintain a positive outlook on life and build
self-confidence.
