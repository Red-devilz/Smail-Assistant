Hey!
Could you please explain what exactly are the two proposals, so that we can

 Hello All!

 We have a specified amount of Alumni Budget this time. The Warden wants to
 use it for the cafeteria and for an outdoor gymnasium. If you people prefer
 to have the quadi relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, please fill
 this form.

 We can, then, let the warden know that majority of the people want the
 quadi to be relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, if that's the case.

 I would be really glad if you could fill this
 <&thstrue
 form ASAP.

 Thank you.

 Kaushik,
 Sports Secretary
