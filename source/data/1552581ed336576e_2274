Body:
Reasons for this :
1. The confusion in the perception of the name
A lot of us may confuse it with the other SAC (Students Activities Centre)
2. The word 'Parliament' rather than a council is much more apt for a team
of legislators
Reasons against this :
1. It has retained this name from more than 20 years
2. Also a lot of other colleges have adapted this name too from IITM
.....
Please reply if you would like to add to any reasons for or against this
change :)

Hope you guys are enjoying your vacations =F0=9F=98=8A
