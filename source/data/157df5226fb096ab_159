Hi everybody,

Whitelogic is an IIT Madras based startup that is currently rearing to
launch some solutions targeted towards some of our Fortune 500 clients. We
have a strong team coming primarily from the CSE Departments at IIT Madras
and IIT Kanpur, as well as some of the best members of our WebOps club.

Our flagship industrial product, SyncOps, involves web development, network
optimisations, heuristics, database optimizations, machine learning,
concurrent programming and graph theoretic problems. SyncOps is going to
remodel industrial operations and process worldwide, and is now at an
advanced stage. The product is being built in close collaboration with
major players in the industry, and a prototype has already has been proven
in the industry.

We=E2=80=99re looking to expand our team to drive SyncOps to the next level=
, and we
have positions open in these two departments:

Software Architecture

This is going to involve advancing and enhancing SyncOps, by working on
various computer science problems, and developing and coding the conceived
solutions. Working in this profile will give you quick exposure to several
core computer science concepts that are taught across the curriculum. If
you're a second year or third year student (or any other year) with an
inclination towards computer science, feel free to apply.

Client Technologies - Coding & Design

SyncOps at this early stage has been praised for its excellent industrial
design. If you're familiar with any of the below technologies, feel free to
apply.

UI/UX (HTML/CSS), Bootstrap, Javascript


Working in any of the above two profiles would significantly sharpen your
abilities to write reliable, fast and professional code, worthy of use in
high-stakes environments.

You=E2=80=99ll be working part time during semester, and then will get to w=
ork
full-time through the winter. Your academic commitments will be respected.
