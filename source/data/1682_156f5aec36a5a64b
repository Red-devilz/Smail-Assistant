 Dear all,
 The Fifth Estate , or T5E, is IITM's studentrun
 campus news body which consistently brings out a plethora of articles, news
 pieces, opeds and photo series featuring various topics and issues for its
 reader base spanning students, faculty, alumni, the press and the general
 public. Over the last one year alone, we reached nearly 1 lakh views on our
 articles and gathered 5K+ new viewers. As of today, T5E has become an
 established platform to actively raise concern, debate or comment on
 anything related to life at IITM.

 The T5E team for the academic year 20162017 took over in May and we
 currently have a few openings for enthusiastic correspondents and WebOps
 coordinators to join our ranks.

 Call for Correspondents

 Correspondents are the building blocks of T5E. Being a T5E correspondent
 gives one an opportunity to cover a variety of stories and interact with
 people from different walks of life. Together with editors, correspondents
 will get to work on articles right from drafting them to their final
 publishing.

 pieces you would have written, to t5e.iitm@gmail.com
 <t5e.iitm@gmail.com.

 Call for WebOperations Coordinators

 Web operations coordinators will be responsible for maintaining the T5E
 website and improving it by implementing new features.
