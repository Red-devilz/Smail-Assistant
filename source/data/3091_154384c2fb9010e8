ABSTRACT :

The current energy crisis resulting from global demand of fossil fuel energ
y has forced humans to look for alternate sources of energy. The abundantly
 available, sparesely distributed renewable nergy sources like solar energy
, wind energy and others are failing to meet the global demand due to their
 inefficiencies and economic viabilities. Hence of late, much attention has
 been given to fuel cell technologies, which can meet the ever increasing e
nergy needs. In our current study , initially 2D simulation of 180 degree b
end is conducted to understand the physics involved in the serpentine bend.
 The geometry is varied in order to observe any changes and when the inlet 
height is increased or the outlet height is increaed, there is formation of
 vortices, which merge and collapse in the outlet branch and enhance the he
at transfer. This study is then extended to 3D domain. In our study, we fou
nd that the Dean's vortices are formed in the threedimensional model in th
e turn region and all the other flow characteristics are similar in nature 
to that of the 2D simulations.

                                                  // ALL ARE WELCOME //
Thanks

With warm welcome
