<div><br>
</div>
<div>DAY, DATE AND TIME: Wednesday 13th of April at 5pm [Tea and snack at 4=
:45pm]</div>

<div>ABSTRACT: One has unusual phenomena in solids largely contributed by t=
he behavior of the electron. One could have instances where on a lattice of=
 notionally&nbsp;<span style=3D"font-size:12pt">equivalent atoms, the elect=
ron is found to favour some atoms over
 others. Alternately, one could have instances where an orbital is favoured=
 over seemingly&nbsp;</span><span style=3D"font-size:12pt">equivalent ones.=
 I will start by an introduction to what tells the electron what to do. Thi=
s gives us the tools to look into the mind
 of the electron and so we&nbsp;</span><span style=3D"font-size:12pt">know =
what to expect when we bring different atoms together to form solids. Start=
ing with examples which confirm with the rules, I will go on to examples wh=
ich are&nbsp;</span><span style=3D"font-size:12pt">the
 law-breakers, taking examples from our research, which is part of the exci=
tement in the study of condensed matter systems.</span></div>
