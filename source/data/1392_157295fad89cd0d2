Linear regression coefficients
by CS14B028 SRINIDHI PRABHU  Wednesday, 14 September 2016, 8:31 PM

Question 5 asks us to report the coefficients of the linear regression
model. But, the data has around 120 dimensions. Do we need to report all
the coefficients in the report? If yes, then should the coefficients be
reported for each dataset or an average over all datasets?
