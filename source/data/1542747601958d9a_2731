Sponsored by IGCS-DST project IIT Madras and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control B=

Pollution by numerous anthropogenic substances threatens water quality worl=
dwide. Micro-pollutants in low levels are difficult to analyse due to need =
for sophisticated instrumentation. Environmental legislation clearly define=
s the need for regular monitoring of pollutants down as low as to nanogram =
per liter levels. Biomonitoring done in parallel with chemical analyses of =
micropollutants, would validate the biomonitoring techniques. There are sev=
eral advances in the field of biomonitoring ranging from laboratory experim=
ents to Automated Biomonitoring in the field.

 European expert groups have developed automated biomonitoring systems for =
water quality. It includes an exposure chamber for housing an aquatic organ=
ism having ventilator behaviour and body movement sensitive to water qualit=
y. Electrodes sense electrical signals produced by the organism during its =
ventilatory behaviour and body movement, and a controller responsive to sig=
nals from the electrodes determines a plurality of ventilatory parameters b=
ased on the signals. The Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor=AE (MFB) can mo=
nitor the toxic risk of chemical mixtures on indicator organisms, which wil=
l be recorded as stress behaviours like ventilation, avoidance, morbidity a=
nd mortality. Automated biomonitors are widely used in European countries a=
nd USA , whereas this technology is new for India.  Till now seven species =
from Indian water bodies are used as indicator organism in MFB and  applied=
 in the sewage quality analysis, fish and prawn farms and rivers by SCMS Wa=
ter Institute experts. So there is a necessity to share this knowledge & te=
chnology to the society which will be a great use for propagation of automa=
ted bio-sensing in India.

In this workshop it is proposed to have informative lectures on state-of-th=
e art in  bio-monitoring and then train participants in use of automated mo=
nitoring  in various fields like aquaculture, water works, water and wastew=
ater treatment plants, waste disposals, drinking/bottled water industries ,=
 solid sludge waste management and river protection agency.

Objective of Workshop:

1.      Introduction to concepts of biomonitoring and laboratory method of =
monitoring

2.      Capacity Building in automated biomonitors using Multispecies Fresh=
water Biomonitoring.

3.      Ideal organism for use in agriculture and aquaculture (by communica=
ting with experts from various fields).

Target Audience: Students/ResearchScholars/Faculty/ Scientists and stakehol=
ders like agricultural farmers and aquaculture farmers who wish to test the=
ir water in the field and pollution control personnel  are also welcome.

Tentative Dates of the Workshop : 2nd to 3rd May, 2016 Venue ICSR Hall I  (=
 Workshop will continue  in the lab/field for  from 3rd May  as required fo=
r the water  samples  )
