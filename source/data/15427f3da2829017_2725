Dear Friends



Bonnut Works is looking to hire motivated, talented  and detail oriented
individuals for the position of intern during May - June of 2016. We are an
early stage venture based out of Bangalore, working in the field of vehicle
servicing. We have started operations early this year and have been
recently selected by a reputed firm in their incubation program. The
interns will also be a part of this and will have a lot of learning in the
program.



 *1. Technical Intern: Web Development* We want someone who is proficient
in web development tools like XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. with a firm
grasp of the back-end and digital space. He/she will be working on the
existing website which is a basic template and will be adding features to
it. The individual should be capable enough to independently handle the
work allotted. An ability to learn new concepts and implement them is
always a positive.



*2. Technical Intern: Android Development *The current android app named
'Bonnut' is a MVP developed to handle initial traffic and is working all
right. While we are working to enhance its capabilities we will like
someone with good understanding of Java coding and an eye for design. A
startup cannot have different UI, UX and coding teams in the initial phases
so the person, while a proficient coder, should have a good aesthetic sense
for the app.



*3. Marketing Intern: Digital Marketing *While we all think we are
proficient at Facebook, twitter and Instagram only few have mastered the
world of digital marketing. We are looking for someone to effectively
manage the digital footprint of Bonnut with understanding of SEO
principles, excellent written abilities and a good understanding of social
media marketing channels. Basic Photoshop/Corel is definite plus.



No matter what your particular role is, you=E2=80=99re going to have the
opportunity to put your hand in every aspect of the business. Your input is
invaluable because whatever another department does usually affects your
work on the product. Marketing, UX design, product management,
engineering=E2=80=94at one point or another you=E2=80=99ll be collaborating=
 with each of
these first hand. So send us your CV's with possible work examples to
contactus@bonnutworks.com



If you have any specific queries feel free to shoot a mail or just give us
a call at 8884917222 and we will be happy to talk.



Thanks
