Mooshak available for Assignment 3
by CS13D023 MANAS THAKUR  Friday, 23 September 2016, 9:14 PM

Dear students,

Mooshakhas been set up for Assignment 3. Please use it for testing your
code. Note the following:

1.Since marks on Mooshak can only be integers, each public testcase
carries 6 marks (6X8D48) and each private testcase carries 1 mark
(1X32D32). This totals to 80; however, we will distribute the marks in th
e
final evaluation such that it adds up to 100 (50+50).

2.Please follow the following submission structure for Mooshak:

	 Put all the source files (along with P3.java) in a directory named as
your rollnumber (in CAPS).
 	 tar czf ROLLNUM.tar ROLLNUM (note that the file is gzipped+tarred, but
the name only has .tar as the extension).

3. For any Mooshakspecific doubts/queries, please refer to the discussions
for the previous assignment before posting the same.

Allthe best!

Regards,
Manas
