Chaitanya, every design need not be novel. Adoption of designs elsewhere,
that aren't implemented in India, yet can bring about significant savings
in resources are always welcome.
And this survey is to judge that.

@Abhinav, there was also some random article online showing how much water
you'd save if one uses buckets/mugs instead. Maybe you can also look into
that for the numbers.
