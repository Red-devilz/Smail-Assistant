Ist : I went to these guys and what they said was intolerable. They said
"some study @ night and some study during day, we had no perfect time to
practice, so we started practicing both times. Near GC, we have insti
library, go study there"
2nd: Went to manager, told the problem, he asked me to talk to lit sec. and
I did. And then I asked manager for the 3rd option, he told me to contact
warden directly.

They showed me the way. So did I.

And as far as adjusting is concerned, I was adjusting with the situaion
from past two days and that was more than enough
 for me. There is a time for everything. You can't just start making noises
@ 1 or 2 am.
