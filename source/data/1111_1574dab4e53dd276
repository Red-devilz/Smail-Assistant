 Hey yE2all,

 Greetings from Centre for Innovation and The Biotech Club!

 The Biotech Club begins its activities this semester with the Club
 Introductory session. Here we clarify the precept that most of you have:

 E2CBiology in school and Biotechnology are not the sameE2D.

 So, what do we do?

 No, we donE2t help people mug the latin names for different specie
s. We
 code, do lab work, field work, and most importantly build novel products
 out of biology. We believe biotechnology is essentially interdisciplinary
 and encourage all of you to turn up, irrespective of your branch.

 In our introductory session, we touch up upon what we do and what you can
 do. We will also brief you about the projects that will be taken up this
 semester and the upcoming club sessions. We await your presence and
 ensure that you will walk out with curiosity and awe for biotechnology.

 Where: CRC 102

 When: 7:30PM, 20th September (Tuesday)

 Requirements: Just enthu, nothing else!

 Cheers!
