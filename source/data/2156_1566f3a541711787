Can be either. Either the submission has to be made on Moodle by 11 45 pm
on Monday or handed over to a TA before 11 45 pm on Monday. Of course in
case you decide to hand it over physically going until the 11 45 pm
deadline might be difficult. The ML tas can be contacted on the email
C2A0cs5011tas2016@googlegroups.com . Many of us are in the CS department 
on
most days and in hostels otherwise. C2A0C2A0
