Greetings from Career Development Team!

Hope all of you are preparing well for your placements and internships.

Although you prepare well enough in the technical aspects, during the
recruitment process it also matters how well your resume describes your
profile and your performances in group discussions & personal interviews.
So it's time to gear yourself up to perform well in these areas too!

Career Development Team, I&AR Student Council is coming up with it's
initiative 'Career Connect' to train students for the most important and
awaited placements and internships.Under this initiative, we will be
organizing the following sessions by ALUMNI and EXPERTS from diverse
fields.These sessions are open only for 3rd year students applying for
internships and final year students.

The Resume Review Session will be organized during 20th  25th of this
month. Interested students, please fill this form

fields and over 250 students attended and found it very insightful. We will
