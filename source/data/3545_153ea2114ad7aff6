b'     Dear All,   Dr. ChanduVisweswariah(from IBM T. J. Watson Research Center) will be  delivering a talk at CSE Dept. (CS25) on April 25th (11:00 AM).  The details are given below.   DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD  Distinguished Alumni Award Recipient Lecture  Date: April 25 , 2016, 11:00 AM  Location: CS25, CSE Dept.  DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD   Title : An Engineering Approach to Saving our Imperiled Planet   Speaker : Chandu Visweswariah, Ph.D. (IITM DAA2016 Recipient) IBM Fellow, Smarter Energy and Environmental Science Director, Smarter Energy Research Institute (SERI) IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York, USA   Abstract : Energy is at the nexus of the economy, the environment, and national security. However, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing our climate and moving the planet towards disastrous tipping points. The solution is to decarbonize our economy by revamping our energy systems. Solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, electric vehicles and heat pumps will all play a major role in this transformation. But what will also be required is realtime predictive optimization software that will optimally plan and orchestrate energy systems of the future. To make human energy needs track the whims of the winds and cloud cover, energy will become digitized, meaning that the generation, transmission and consumption of energy will be controlled by digital algorithms. This seminar will explain the climate crisis, as well as details of a path to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.   Bio : Chandu Visweswariah is the Director of the Smarter Energy Research Institute at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY. He was named an IBM Fellow in 2013, the highest technical honor conferred by IBM. He leads Smarter Energy and Environmental Science at IBM Research. Prior to this position, Chandu was a Distinguished Engineer in Electronic Design Automation in IBM\'s Systems and Technology Group, where he led a team responsible for correct signal timing in all IBM chips, and drove the invention and deployment of such innovations as statistical timing and automatic circuit tuning.  Chandu obtained a B. Tech. from IIT Madras, M. S. from Carnegie Mellon University, and PhD also from Carnegie Mellon in 1985, 1986 and 1989, respectively, and joined IBM Research in 1989. In 2002, he was a visiting faculty member at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. He won an "Innovator of the Year" award from EDN Magazine in 2006. He has won numerous IBM Corporate Awards, Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards, Outstanding Innovation Awards and Best Paper Awards. Chandu is an IBM Fellow, Fellow of the IEEE, Member of the IBM Academy of Technology, IBM Master Inventor, and has over 100 publications and 95 granted patents to his name.  DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD  All are cordially invited to attend the lecture.   Thanks and regards,  Aritra.
