Thanks for your support!

Hi =
RAHUL=
=
,

Today is a big day. Last month, we announced that we were launching a pai=
d version of Nylas N1. And today, it's here.

Nylas Pro includes all the powerful features you've become familiar with =
as an early adopter of N1=E2=80=94open and click tracking, snooze, enrich=
ed contact profiles, send scheduling, mail merge, templates, and more.

To thank you for your support and feedback, we want to give you a year of=
 Nylas Pro for free! We couldn't have gotten here without you.

Your coupon code:

=
This coupon (an $84 value) can only be used once and expires in two weeks=
. You can redeem it by downloading/updating N1 and clicking "Upgrade to N=
ylas Pro" in the Subscription section of Preferences.

If you want to financially support Nylas and open source software, you ca=
n still pay for a Nylas Pro upgrade. We're working to build a sustainable=
 business and really value your support. Thanks! &#128588;

=E2=80=94Team Nylas
