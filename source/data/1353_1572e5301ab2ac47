Queen of Sheeba is here!! || September 17 || 12.30 PM

Body:
Greetings!!

The Queen of Sheeba summons you all for her annual LitSoc event. The Queen
has been aching to add new tokens to her collection and as subjects, we aim
to please.

As the first LitSoc event of the year, we are hoping for great
participation from all the hostels! The event will be split into 3
sections:Prelude,
Mezzo, Apogee. Be on the lookout on your hostel group for more details on
the same.

Timings:

Prelude 12:30 pm 1:30 pm

Mezzo: 1:30 pm 5.15 pm

Apogee:5:30  6.30 pm

Rules:

The game starts off with a treasure hunt at 12.30. Team HQ will be Himalaya
lawns. Each hostel needs to have 3 representatives(Lit/Soc Sec or any
others, all of whom should fill their details here
)

The team that finishes treasure hunt will get a part of the list
beforehand. This time lead will be crucial in ensuring that you appease the
queen and win more points. The full list will be released at 1.30

The queen demands punctuality.Those who waste her time will be fed to her
hungry minions, at least a couple of whom have lost their heads setting
these tasks.

You are expected to submit your items at SAC at 5.15 p.m. A 15 minute
window has been allotted for this ( of course, you will lose 2 points for
every minute in between) but the doors will firmly shut at 5.30 and no
further submissions will be allowed, however persuasive or pretty the
students are.

The queen has set a few of her above mentioned minions with the task of
conducting this event. Their word is law. Do not second guess/ argue with
them. Do so at the risk of losing points/ facing disqualification.

E2BWith regard to the counting of points, the LitSec and SocSec of ea
ch
hostel will be allowed  inside the counting arena. We have interesting
plans for the others, rest assured. A surprise event awaits some of those
who wait outside that could well tip the points scale for your hostel. Once
the counting is done, the hostel that turns up satisfying the queenE2
s last
request will get a last chance to score a few bonus points.

Any discrepancies or ambiguities will be clarified, should they arise. If
they aren't, wing it and hope the Queen's minions agree with you.

Points for this LitSoc event will be:

1st 35 points

2nd 25 points

3rd 20 points

4th 15 points

All participating hostels will also be awarded 5 points.

The event will start at 12:30 pm, 17th September, 2016. Wait for our mail
with more details.

Cheers
