GIAN course 'Extreme waves in Ocean Engineering', 21 Mar to 1 Apr.

Body:
b'     Dear Students     Greetings.&nbsp;   I wishto inform you that a twoweek course on \'Extreme waves in Ocean Engineering\' underGIANprogramme of Govt of India during will be conducted during 21 Mar. to 1 Apr. 2 016. This course will be conducted in coordination with Prof. Felice Arena,University of Reggio, Italy. div    This course would be useful if you want to understand the basic oceanwave generation mechanism or interested in understanding the design wave concept (say, 50 year/100 year wave climate)required for offshore system design. T he lectures will be deliveredduring afternoon everyday.  If you are interested, you have to register at&n;bsp;  Thecoursebrochures can be found in     Coursecontents   1 Mechanics of windgenerated waves in the spacetime domain  Wave field in the open sea, random surface elevation and velocity potential, directional spectrum.  Crosscovariances either in homogeneous and nonhomogeneous random wave fields.  2 The Theory of QuasiDeterminism  Overview of the proofs. The deterministic free surface displacement and the velocity potential in spacetime domain when a high wave occurs. Threedimensional wave groups in spacetime. Application from experimental data. Application of the QD theory for wavestructure interaction. Effects of nonlinearity.  3 Equivalent Power Storm  The concept of EPS. Regression Base Height. Return period of extreme significant wave height and average persistence. The EPS model to describe extreme waves during storms. Application to determine the design wave for marine structures    I n this programme,UG/P G st udents, research scholars   ca n take 2 c redits with the approval of their faculty advisors. T o ea rn the credit, the students/ scholars shouldtake the evaluation (test/ tutotrial/ assignment etc.) on 2nd April .  I request you to circulate to those interested. I would be happy to clarify any queries.
