Deepawali plea

Body:
b'                  Dear campus resident,  The following is a plea to consider a fireworkfree and pollutionfree Deepavali/Diwali inside our campus.   The quantity and impact of firecrackers that were available a generation ago was far lesser than what is available now. So, things that were acceptable 20 years ago may no longer be acceptable today due to the quantum of pollution it can create. Every year there are a large number of injuries and few fatalities due to firecrackers. This is a well known hazard and many countries do not permit private citizens to light fire crackers in unsupervised conditions.  On the IITM campus, use of firecrackers has adverse outcomes. The campus is the shared home of many species of animals, many species of birds including winter migrants who fly in from many hundreds of miles. On account of the noise and pollution of the firecrackers, trauma in animals can lead to severe consequences. A little bit of sensitivity on our part can help the animals and other species tremendously. We urge you to pay a little attention to their distress and convince yourself on the merits of our line of thought.   As per the MOEF, Govt of India, guidelines, an educational institution, needs to be considered as Silence Zone. () The following in a supreme court rule regarding firecrackers and pollution (page 22 of the reference above)is applicabletosilence&nb;sp;zones : "(3) Firecrackers shall not be used at any time in silence zones, as defined in S.O. 1046(E) issued on 22.11.2000 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. In the said Notification Silence Zone has been defined as: " Silence Zone is an area comprising not less than 100 meters around hospitals, educational institutions, courts, religious places or any other area which is declared as such by the competent authority."  While there are many mitigating circumstances (we understand !!), we think it may be worthwhile to atleast ponder these questions before reaching for the wallet to pay for firecrackers.  Prakriti strongly urges you to consider an ecofriendly Deepavali/Diwali celebration, giving special consideration for our campus flora and fauna.  Wish you all a joyous Diwali/Deepavali.     _______________________________________________ Students mailing list  Students@smail.iitm.ac.in <br  a  _______________________________________________ Phd mailing list  Phd@smail.iitm.ac.in     '
