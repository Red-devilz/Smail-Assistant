Hello folks,

Greetings from the *IITM Associations Team, I&AR Student Council!*


There is something which connects us to Insti emotionally. We, in some way
or other, take pride in being a part of it. With IITM Affinity Program, we
give this emotion and pride a shape, something a bit more deeper to connect
to.

What better way to do so than deals which gives discounts and privileges
exclusively for our *IITM family!!*

At Associations Team, we work hard to add value to your identity as an
IITian

because...

*YOU DESERVE IT!*

To accommodate the size of our dream, we are working hard to extend the
geographies and extent of its reach to our sister IITs, making Affinity
Program a pan India privilege to all IITians across verticals
