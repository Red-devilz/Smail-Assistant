We had met on 17th August in your Campus for the French Day Hosted by your team.    The reason for which I am writing to you is that the French Embassy is hosting an Education Fair on October 1st, 2016 in Chennai with 30 French Institutions participating in this event  (registration link mentioned below). This is a unique opportunity where students will be able to have a one on one interaction with some of the best Management and Engineering Schools in France.    For this purpose, I would like to put forward a request to you to meet your students to do a small presentation on study opportunities in France which would also include a fun quiz for the students on France as well as promote our fair to them as well.    Kindly let me know if I could contact or meet you to discuss this further or if there would be an appropriate time I could visit your esteemed Institution to meet your students.    Looking forward to a positive response.
