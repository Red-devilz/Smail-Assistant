Do you know that certain big-shot companies like HUL do not come for
placements and recruit directly through internships?

Do you realize the importance internships can have in helping you achieve
your long term goals?

Wanna interact with companies of both core and non-core profiles to help
you make informed decisions related your career ?

Do you want to know how you as a team member can make a difference with
your creative initiatives?

Come up with all your ideas and questions,we will be glad to answer them in
the fundae session
