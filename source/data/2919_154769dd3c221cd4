Subject:
Gangasters Levelling of Quadrangle or Outdoor Gymnasium

Body:
Hello All!

We have a specified amount of Alumni Budget this time. The Warden wants to
use it for the cafeteria and for an outdoor gymnasium. If you people prefer
to have the quadi relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, please fill
this form.

We can, then, let the warden know that majority of the people want the
quadi to be relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, if that's the case.

I would be really glad if you could fill this
<&thstrue
form ASAP.

Thank you.

Kaushik,
Sports Secretary
