Hello gangsters,
The hostel office requests you to take all your belongings in the ground
floor dump room (near office room) on or before 21-08-2016.If not , the
hostel office is not responsible for any thing missing in the room as that
room is adjoint with the music room which will be used frequently.
                   Thank you.
Regards
  Naveen
