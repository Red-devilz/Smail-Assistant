Subject:
Review and Feedback of Legislators - Student Legislative Council

Body:
Hi!

It's nearing the end of our semester and with that, it is time for us to
get feedback from all of you regarding how we have been working these past
few months. While a pan SLC review form is in the offing, we thought we
would start with understanding how you people think your legislators have
worked.

Please spend two minutes filling the forms given below to review your
hostel and department/research legislators. Based on your feedback, course
corrections shall be carried out.

Hoping to see an enthusiastic response before the 16th of October!

Department/Research Legislator Review form

Cheers!
