 Dear Sir

 I am keen to opt for the "GN6101 Strategies for Professional growth 
 Getting ready for a corporate life" course. This course  according to the
 academic website  is being offered in the 'J' slot.

 I spoke to a couple of friends who had opted the course this semester and
 found out that the classes are conducted in the evenings on two days a
 week. My question is if the same pattern is going to be followed. Because
 if otherwise, I do not stand a chance to opt for this course since I have a
 course in the Q slot which clashes with the J slot.

 Kindly clarify this query of mine.

 Thanking You
 Yours sincerely
