The Institute wants to encourage such exchange programs as they provide our students with exposure to global teaching & research practices.    It can happen sometimes that the semesters at IITM and the host institution do not exactly align. Under such circumstances, the student is required to take prior approval from his/ her Faculty Advisor, HoD and DeanAcademic Courses for a late return/ attendance of classes. In such cases, course faculty are requested to accommodate these students in view of the prior permission taken. Attendance may be marked from the date of rejoining.    Please note that this exemption does not extend to summer research internships. In this case, the student is required to return & register as per the published academic schedule.    Thank you.       With regards....  Prof. R. Nagarajan  Department of Chemical Engineering Dean, International & Alumni Relations IIT Madras  email: deaniar@iitm.ac.in Phone: +91 9444008390       '
