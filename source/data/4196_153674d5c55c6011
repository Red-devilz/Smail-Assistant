Re: Gangasters Hostel Soap Box

Body:
Good Idea to keep a check on the performance of current secretaries.
Secretaries can highlight the work completed, work in progress and work not
undertaken at all. I would encourage the current secretaries to get their
manifesto reviewed by past secretaries which are currently in 4th year in
our hostel.
I would also like to propose the mention of the % work done out of all
manifesto points in the certificate which secretaries get during Hostel
Night. This step will give better recognition to the people who have
covered a substantial number of points proposed in the manifesto and a
similar disadvantage for people who put peace and take these positions just
for namesake PORs.

 Guys, I think it's important to have manifesto review for all the
 current secretaries to see what has been done in the past year. Let this
 happen before the soapbox. I hope the aspiring hostel legislators will
 have an extra interest in this.

 Best regards,
