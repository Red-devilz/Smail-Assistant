Hi!

It's working fine for me. Always open the browser and go to "yahoo.com".
Though, it should work with any website as per their claim, but I have
found it inconsistent. However, going to yahoo.com always opens up the nfw
page asking for credentials.

Anyone else having trouble with the new firewall? The automatic auth
refresh doesn't seem to be working for me. Anyone knows where we can
complain about this?
