Temporaries in functions
by CS14B056 VISHWANATH G V  Monday, 24 October 2016, 6:36 PM

Sir,

Youhave mentioned that the registers we will use for register allocation
are global. A register replaces a temporary variable. Within a function,
can I count all uses of a temporary (e.g., T1) as a local variable?

E.g.,

Function1 [2]

E..MOVE T1 0 ...

Function2[2]

E..MOVE T1 T2 ...

CanI treat T1 in Function1 as different from T1 in function2?

Inother words, can I assume that register allocation can be done
independently for each function?
