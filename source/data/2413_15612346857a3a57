Alumni Card Collection

Body:
This is for the students graduating this year, other please ignore.

Dear soontobe Alumni,

You can collect your alumni cards from IITMAA Office (near CCW Office)
today, 22nd July (during office hours) or on AlumNite (at CLT), 23rd July.
This card will be your identity as a member of IITM community once you
graduate and will also be a gateway to amazing privileges that you enjoy as
an alumnus/alumna.

Regards,
