Hi all,

An insti alumnus, Adhiraj (2007 batch) is doing a survey for a startup idea
in the social space. It's to understand people's interest in saving the
environment. Your answers will help understand how to make people live more
environment friendly lives.

It will take less than 2 min to fill. Here is the link to the survey



Please share your thoughts on the above link, and share the link with your
friends.

Thanks


Adhiraj Alai
