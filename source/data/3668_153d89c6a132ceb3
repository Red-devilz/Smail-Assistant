Re: Gangasters Fwd: 3-D Animation Event

Body:
Hey, forward it to your respective hostel groups.


Hello everyone!

We have all gone through that phase when we watched cartoons and wonder how
the magic happens. Many of us even harbor dreams of someday mastering
animation and making such cartoons.

In order to make those dreams a reality, we, the Animation Club of CFI, in
collaboration with Techsoc, bring to you a series of 3D Animation
sessions, focused on developing animation models from basics. There are 3
sessions planned for this purpose. Tentative schedule of these sessions:
