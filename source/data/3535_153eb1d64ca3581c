 Hi all
 The 4th years and 5th year ED junta, please compile your data seeing the
 responses of the RG form. I have already shared the response sheet with
 many final years, do take from your friends and if you have your own form
 take data from both hostel RG form and ur form and edit the content. Sit
 with your friends for editing and if you need any help in that, do inform
 me by sending a mail to my email id. Please send the edited content by 5th
 night or maximum by 6th April 12 noon so that it can be given
 for print after designing it further.
 Regards
