Dear all,

Apology for the confusion! The venue for ACM is ICSR Auditorium and not

Hello,

Greetings from ECell, aka the Entrepreneurship Cell of the institute!

It's time when the ECell will finally be having its ACM (Aspiring
Coordinators Meet) with an aim to recruit its coordinators and thus, you
will get a chance to be a part of this organisation.

The primary work of ECell is to spread awareness about the vast
opportunities that entrepreneurship provides and motivate the budding
entrepreneurs, through the flagship Sprouts program, lecture series,
workshops, brainstorming sessions and other intrainstitute competitions.

Currently, one of the best teams in the institute, ECell has grown
rapidly within its last few years of inception. We seek to be an exemplary
organization for selecting, mentoring, launching and supporting young
people into technobusiness entrepreneurship.

The Aspiring Coordinators Meet is planned for the following departments:
a) Events, Networking and Outreach,
b) Student Relations and Onground Publicity
c) Creative Media Publicity
d) Sponsorship and PR
e) Logistics and Finance
f) Design
g) Editorial and Research

The ACM will happen on:
070816 (Sunday) at 6pm in CLT

The applications will be released the very same day after the ACM.

All students interested in applying to any ECell 201617 coordinator
position are strongly advised to attend the ACM. We have positions open for
all the students, Undergraduate and Post graduate.
