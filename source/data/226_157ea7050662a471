Dear All,
The following query was asked by Gowri Shankar on a different thread. I am
deleting the original post, and copying it verbatim over here.

Inclass we discussed about an approximation for determining the live
interval for a temporary, where we said the the temporary is approximated
to be live from the starting point of the first interval to the end point
of the last interval.C2A0
This may lead to some redundant interference.

Alsoin the class sir told that the no of registers used will be checked
and indeed the output requires us to print it.
So my question is can we do this approximation? Are we expected to use only
a predetermined no of spilled args(this approximation may not satisfy the
count) or is there any kind of threshold for it?C2A0

Canyou elaborate on how the check on no of registers will be done?C2A0


Thanks.

I repeat my request: Please post all your doubts and discussions on the
same thread (THIS thread). It is much easier that way to track all the
posts, especially while we are not receiving any emails.
Thanks.

Warmregards,
Aman (TA CS3300)
