Dear students, faculty and staff,

As many of you are aware, free Samskrutam classes have been going on in our  
campus for last four years. The classes are taught by Sri Nikesh ji and  
Mrs. Mamatha Mahindrakar, volunteers of Samskrita Bharati, a nonprofit  
organization working to revive Samskrutam.

Regular classes for the new batch of students will begin in September.  
There is absolutely no fees, and anyone can join; no prior knowledge of  
Samskrutam is required.

Prior to these regular classes, we are conducting a twoweekend Spoken  
Sanskrit Workshop (Samskruta Shibiram) to motivate and let students know  
how easy it is to learn Samskrutam. Details of the workshop (shibiram) are  
as follows:

Days: 27th Aug (Saturday) &amp; 28th Aug (Sunday)
Timings: 2 pm  6 pm with two teabreaks of 15 min each in between
Venue: ESB 106, Department of Electrical Engineering.

Please register for the workshop by filling in the following registration  
form. Although you can attend the workshop without registering below, it  
will help us in taking care of the logistics.

Please contact me over email or phone (9952046525) if you have any queries.
