<p><strong>Abstract: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=3D"text-align: justify;">There are 206 bones in the human body of =
which 26 are in the spine. The neck has 7 cervical vertebrae; the top two a=
re the Atlas and the Axis which support the brain. The remaining five C3 to=
 C7 that support the head are subject
 to injury or to decay due to OA (orthopedic arthritis) or RA (rheumatoid a=
rthritis). Injury to these vertebrae is also due to auto collisions which c=
ause whiplash often partially separating one to five of them.<strong>
</strong>Spinal injury is caused by one of three types of severe force- lon=
gitudinal compression, hinging, and shearing. Longitudinal compression, usu=
ally due to a fall from a height, crushes the vertebrae (segments of the sp=
ine) lengthwise against each other.
 Hinging (in this presentation), which can occur in a whiplash injured in a=
utomobile industry, subjects the column to sudden extreme bending movements=
. Shearing, which may occur when a person is knocked over by a motor vehicl=
e, for example, combines both hinging
 and rotational (twisting) forces<strong>. </strong>Because of the spinal c=
ord it is not possible to separate injured vertebrae and introduce a ligame=
nt as can be done with the hip, knee, and shoulder joints. In the&nbsp; US =
a titanium plate (Ti-64 ELI) is held
 on the vertebrae and screwed on to the neck, for example with a two verteb=
rae injury the plate will have six holes and six screws. The screws used ar=
e the state of the art in design having to function as a fastener, as a tap=
 to cut threads, and also to drill
 pilot hole into the soft bone. The US material is also a state of the art =
with the introduction of ELI (extra low interstitial) variants like oxygen =
and iron into Ti-64 which elevates fracture toughness and also combats toxi=
city levels in the human body. Failure
 is of the order of 1% and severe penalties are imposed for these injuries;=
 it thus becomes a litigation research. Typical American goals are zero tol=
erance for failure where human life is involved. With the increase in vehic=
ular traffic worldwide this type
 of injury will only increase. The cause for failure of the screws is mainl=
y fatigue which is inevitable as the head moves in various directions conti=
nuously. The body fluid despite ELI also promotes failure once the fatigue =
crack propagates. The cracks are
 typical shell clam type of large radii and occur in multiple planes. Resea=
rch in this area in India is essential due to its enormous growth in vehicu=
lar production and in import. UNLV through its two arms- Global Alliance an=
d Industrial Consultancy can help
 IIT Madras in this direction by submitting a research proposal to the Depa=
rtment of Science &amp; Technology, New Delhi.
