My miniRA code generated for BinarySearch.microIR throws the following
error:

Illegalheap write value (0+421), must be 080 and divisible by 4.
Please check near the following source code:
HSTORE s6 0 s3 (line:610 col:23)

Whatdoes this error mean and what can I do to rectify it?

Also,there is no miniRA code available for BinarySearch over here
:C2A0~krishna/cs3300/miniRA/

Mycode works for all the other public test cases.

Thanks,

Ajay
