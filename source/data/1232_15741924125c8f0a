Re: CS3310 - Compilers Lab 1 evaluation

Body:
Hey, is it possible for me to come now.( around say 2:15). My lab and 
class both got cancelled. Of course 4:30 should be fine too if you are 
busy now, but I'd like to finish it early if that's okay.
Thanks a lot.

 Hi Rahul,
 
 Yes, you can change a few lines of your code with some penalty. 
 Monday 4.30 works for me, you can meet me in CV lab.

 Hi,
 
 I am Rahul, and I had a couple of queries regarding the Compilers 
 Lab 1 evaluation. I had missed a single print statement in my final 
 submission, due to which none of the programs that parsed, printed 
 out correctly.
 Is it possible to get it reevaluated after changing the code? What 
 would be a good time for the same since I believe, I am required to 
 show you the changes in person. I'd prefer Monday maybe around 4:30 
 but any other time should be fine too.
 Thanks.
 
 
 Rahul Ramesh
