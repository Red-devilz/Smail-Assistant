Respected Sir/Mam,
This is Utsav Bhardwaj, M.S. Scholar from Department of Mechanical
Engineering. I want to sing a Bollywood Hindi Song on this event. Is there
any preregistration  required ? Can I bring some karaoke for it in a
pendrive, which can be played over there ?
I will be highly thankful to you for a kind response.

With Sincere Regards
Utsav Bhardwaj
