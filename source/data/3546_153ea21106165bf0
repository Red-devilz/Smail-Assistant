b"     On behalf of Prof M.P Maiya     Announcement of Guest Lecture    Topic:     Combined Power and Cooling    Speaker:    Prof. Alberto Coronas    &nbsp;     Universitat Rovira i Virgili</strong    &nbsp;      Department of Mechanical Engineering, CREVER    &nbsp;     Avda.Paisos Catalans, 26, 430, Tarragona, Spain  Venue:    Seminar room, RAC Laboratory Date:    11042016 Day: &nbsp;   Monday  Time: &nbs;p;  4:00 to 5:00 pm High Tea: 3:45 pm All are welcome  Abstract The combined production of decentralized electricity and cold using efficient thermallydriven systems are one of the suitable technological solutions to address the current global energyrelated challenges. These challenges include energy supply uncertainty, rising price of fuels and adverse environmental impact. Airconditioning, refrigeration and electricity are useful forms of energy products, usually produced using separate energy conversion technologies. Further, most endusers need at least dual energy products: typical example could be building's applications where space airconditioning and electricity for various purposes are in need.  The guest lecture enumerates on the development of new class of combined absorption systems (cycles), capable to produce mechanical power and cold simultaneously and/or alternatively by using a single thermal energy source available at low and medium temperatures below 300B0C.
