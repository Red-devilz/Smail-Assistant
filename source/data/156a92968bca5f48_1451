Hello ,

This concerns the students who attended the session by Volkswagen.

For the Volkswagen Race event happening in Irungattukotai, institute buses
won't be going.For those who are interested, to reach the Madras Motor Race
Track,MTC buses from main gate can be taken- first to Poonamallee and from
there to Irungattukottai;it typically takes around 1.5 hrs. The tower
stands in the stadium offer the best view.

For any urgent queries ,you can contact the Auto Club Convener Krithikesh
at 9500010664.

Regards
