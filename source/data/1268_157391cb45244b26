Greetings,

The Accessibility Summit Team, Shaastra 2017 brings to you,

Hackathon for the Visually Impaired

IndiaE2s first ever blind hackathon.


A hackathon is an event where people gather and build programs together.
The Hackathon for the Visually Impaired will be an event for the visually
challenged to build programs which improve our lives and the world.

To bring out the best from our participants, and to make the visually
challenged more employable, independent and selfsufficient, Shaastra, in
collaboration with VisionAid ,
is conducting a Programming Course for the Visually Impaired.


Python Programming For the Visually Impaired


What?


This is an introductory level course in Python programming for the visually
challenged. The goal of the program is to help students with no prior
exposure to computer science to learn to think computationally and write
programs to tackle useful problems. The course is based on MITE2s on
line
course, is made with the help of MITE2s professors and will be taugh
t by an
IIT Madras alumnus living in Massachusetts.


How you can help?


We are currently looking for volunteers to help us conduct the course. If
you know Python and want to teach, let us know by filling up this form

course structure will be provided upon registration.
