Dear Vishwanath,

	 Yes, for the purpose of our assignment, all temporaries used in a
function can be assumed to be local to that function. For example, TEMP1 in
function F1 can be considered different from TEMP1 in function F2.
 	 As long as you save/restore caller and calleesaved registers
appropriately, register allocation can be done independently for each
function.

p.s.: If possible, please use the main thread for posting your messages. It
will be helpful for others to have all messages in a single thread.

Thanks.
Warmregards,
Aman.
