Dear all,
The cycle rally which was going to take place tomorrow morning is cancelled
temporarily as we couldn't get the permission from Chennai traffic police.
But I am really happy to see the response which we got for this rally from
you all. Lets not get discouraged and carry this spirit by coming forward
and cleaning our campus on this Independence Day! Soon, I will let you
know the details of the event.

Jai Hind!

 Hello everyone,

 The past week, we have hosted a huge number of events in the run up to our
 70th Independence Day celebrations. Students have participated in essay
 writing competitions, elocution competitions and music competitions among
 others, with the overarching theme being patriotism. But is this all that
 patriotism is about? We, the student representatives of IIT Madras, feel
 otherwise. True patriotism is making a real change on the ground and we
 feel that it is time for the students of IIT Madras to start taking baby
 steps towards making the world we live in a better place  a place without
 dirt and garbage.

 The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched by the Govt. of India in order to
 make a 'Clean India'. It's been nearly two years since this campaign has
 been launched and we feel that one small, but important way in which we can
 make a change in society is by joining this campaign and creating awareness
 about the same. Towards this end, on the morning of 14th of August at
 5:30 am, we plan to hold a Cycle Rally from Gajendra Circle to Besant
 Nagar beach.This shall be followed by a cleanup drive in Besant Nagar
 beach and distribution of gifts to cleanliness workers at the beach and in
 our institute. A parallel cleanliness drive will also be taking place in
 our campus.

 Students interested in being a part of this are requested to fill this
  form. All participants shall get
 free TShirts. Safety equipment for cleanup and refreshments shall be
 provided.

 Let's make a better and cleaner India, together.

 Jai Hind!
