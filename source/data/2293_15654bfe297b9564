 Sir,

 The following is stated as the final point in the below mentioned linked :

 
 

 e) A student who has already completed the internship curricular
 requirement (through Department/ Institute or otherwise) will not be
 allowed to sit for core internships. The student has to sign a declaration
 before the written test/interview that they have neither received a core
 internship offer nor have they completed the curricular requirement.

 Can you kindly clarify if students(in their 3rd years) who proceed to
 credit their internship, become ineligible to sit for core internships?

 Myself and a few others also had a couple of doubts regarding the
 documentation for the internship:

 1)  I and couple of others have worked alongside our classmates(on the
 same project) during the internship and hence our documentations may be
 very similar in content. Hence, is each individual required to write the
 documentation in their own words, or would one documentation for a group of
 2 or 3 who worked on the same project suffice?

 2) The company is required to approve that no confidential content was
 present in our documentation. Would a simple exchange of mails for the same
 be sufficient or are we required to attach some form of formal proof from
 the company?

 Thank you sir for your valuable time.
