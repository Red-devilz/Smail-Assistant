Hi everyone,
Greetings from CS Club!!



Applications for the post of Hospitality Coordinator of Exebit2017 are
now open.Exebit is the Annual Technical Fest of our Computer Science and
Engineering Department.

The Hospitality team will mainly take care of the accommodation for the
students who come from other colleges and help them in the registration
process for their interested events.Hospitality team will serve as the
first point of contact for the participants if they have any doubts or
queries.So I think this a unique opportunity for you to interact with
several people and manage a huge crowd.

Interested students are requested to fill the following google form and
submit it by 5th October 2016.
