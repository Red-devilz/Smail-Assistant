 Friends,
 Please do not park in the NOPARKING zones... because it makes it
 difficult for those who have parked their cycles inside to take them
 outside.
 Or from today onwards the security guards will lock those cycles up :(

 Expecially on the right side parking (when leaving the hostel)

 Hope you guys take notice :)
