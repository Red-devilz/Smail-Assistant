 Dear all,

 Warm greetings from The Fifth Estate team!

 Many of you would have returned to campus this new academic year after
 spending a summer working on various projects and internships. T5E will be
 publishing its Internship Series soon, consisting of articles written
 by insti students about their internships this summer. You can check out
 some of our internship articles from previous years here
 .

 This year, we are opening out the invitation to all of you. Students
 across all years, programs and departments are welcome to send in their
 internship stories. If you have worked on something this summer that
 doesn't fit into the usual core, noncore, research categories, don't
 worry! We place no bars on type of internship for this series, in fact the
 more outoftheway your project, the better!

 Please make sure to include the following as you write:


     How did you think of applying and what was the application
    process/story behind getting the internship?
     What was your internship profile?
     What work did you do?
     Apart from work details: where were you posted, how did you enjoy
    your time outside of work, who did you get to meet?

 Do make sure to include photographs with your writeup and send it to t5e.iitm@gmail.com
 <t5e.iitm@gmail.com. We prefer that you upload your articles on Google
 Doc and send us a link to the same. We'll be taking in submissions till midnight,
 18th September. Selected articles will be published on T5E as part of
 our Internship Series starting first week of October.

 Hoping to hear from all of you, and have fun writing!
 Warm regards,
