Re: Gangasters Diwali Sweets?

Body:
Hi Vibin,
The decision to postpone the Diwali celebrations after it was passed in the
budget,not sure if it was your decision to make but was nevertheless a
wrong one. In fact the HHS said that no money was allocated for Diwali. Did
he not read our Budget?
If you wanted to postpone the celebration, you should have raised the issue
during the GBM. I sense a lack of enthusiasm which is perhaps due the
secretaries having quizzes. You should plan this before hand and manage you
time. Money allocated for Diwali should be utilized for Diwali and not for
post Diwali celebrations.

Thanks and Regards,

 Hi everyone

 Sorry for the late reply.
 As this Diwali was in a weekend, many localities weren't there in
 institute.so we  decided to celebrate the week after diwali.The exact
 details will be intimated soon in the IP.
 Money allocated for Diwali will be spent for informal events(post Diwali
 celebration).

 Hi,
 I thought the decision was taken to organize extra night to
 utilize the residue funds but not to replace the existing thing. Moreover,
 I do see ,in the existing budget 3000 Rs alloted for Diwali. Also, there
 are not two but three festivals mentioned in GBM. PFA.
 Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks.
