 It will be anonymous only. The thought behind this was to make sure no
 one is gen putting anything and that the forms are filled by genuine people
 involved only but if the case is, people will be forced to reveal the
 identity, I changed the settings of the form.

 RGs have traditionally been anonymous. Any good reason you want to
 record the username of the person who is RGing? That's as good as forcing
 people to reveal their identity.

 Thanks,

 Some additions
 The form includes 4th years with some 5th years ED junta (if anyone
 else from 5th year who didn't had RG last year can inform me). Also the
 info can be provided by anyone interested and who know these people
 properly and in case any person is wrongly assigned in a wing (might be due
 to CCW list cups) , contact me asap.
