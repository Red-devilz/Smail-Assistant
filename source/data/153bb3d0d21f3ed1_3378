<p style=3D"text-align:left">=93The nuclear sciences based technology footp=
rint (in the USA alone) is estimated at over $500B (~25% of India's GDP), n=
ot even including the nuclear defense and security sectors; this footprint =
covers arenas as wide as energy, medicinal
 imaging-therapy-sterilization, radiography, agriculture, propulsion, indus=
trial (e.g., aluminum-steel, LNG) safety from explosions, environmental eff=
luent detoxification and remediation, food preservation, genetics and gener=
al industrial applications spanning
 superconductivity, thermal (e.g., CHF) performance enhancements during boi=
ling, newsprint metering, polymerizing, molecular structural designs and ev=
en areas as mundane as shrink tubing, wrinkle-free clothing and super-hydro=
philicity. It is virtually impossible
 to find a discipline that does not benefit from nuclear based sciences and=
 related technologies. The speaker has led and conducted research for over =
35 years in academia, industry and government in a multitude of these arena=
s. His talk will provide a broad-based
 introduction into these cited areas and then focus on developing collabora=
tive opportunities with IIT-M in several of his research group=92s multi-di=
sciplinary technologies, currently under commercialization (by Sagamore-Ada=
ms Laboratories, LLC) pertaining to
 novel sensors for use in energy-security sectors, general engineering phys=
ics education, combating lung cancer, environmental monitoring, cavitation =
control in fluid systems, and development of VOC-free, biodegradable, radia=
tion tailored polymers deployed
 in the construction, auto, etc. industries.=94&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D"text-align:left">Rusi Taleyarkhan received his B.Tech. in Mech.=
 Engr. in 1977 from IIT-M, India followed with an Masters in Business Admin=
istration (MBA) and Ph.D in Nuclear Engineering by 1982 from Rensselaer Pol=
ytechnic Institute, NY, USA. He has
 since worked as Senior Engineer with Westinghouse Electric. Corp. through =
1988 after which he spent over 17 years where he was Program Director and D=
istinguished R&amp;D Engineer at U.S.DOE=92s Oak Ridge National Laboratory =
conducting and leading energy, defense
 and energy related projects =96 both classified and unclassified. He joine=
d Purdue University in 2003 as Professor of Nuclear Engineering where he te=
aches and conducts multi-disciplinary research. He also serves as Chief Tec=
hnology Officer of S/A Laboratories,
 LLC a venture capital based startup dedicated towards commercialization of=
 technologies resulting from his research group related to: combating nucle=
ar terrorism, thermonuclear fusion energy, materials synthesis, green-chemi=
stry based coatings and adhesives
 tailored via radiation polymerization, novel metastable state-based nuclea=
r particle sensors for homes (e.g., Radon monitors), environmental assessme=
nts, and for Fossil-Nuclear Power plants, explosive burst-based hydrogen pr=
oduction / super-cooled powders,
 and cavitation prevention in fluid systems. He has published over 175 arti=
cles in the archival literature, and has received over 25 invention awards =
besides numerous industry and govt. recognitions. During 2004 his work was =
declared by Science News as Top
 10 science discoveries and, by the Energy Times as World=92s Top 6 Must-Do=
 research projects for the 21st Century. Prof. Taleyarkhan has consulted ex=
tensively for various national and international bodies. He is a Fellow of =
the American Nuclear Society, and
 Honorary Fellow of the Russian Academy of Sciences; member of ASME, TMS,..=
, and past Editor of Nuclear Safety journal.<br>
