ABSTRACT :	


The possibility of employing both RayleighTaylor (RT) and KelvinHelmholt
z (KH) mechanisms parametric conditions, which is advantageous to interfac
e distortion. In addition, this study also reveals that for a given energy,
 the length scale associated with destabilization due to radial acceleratio
n simultaneously as equal contributors to the primary destabilization proce
ss is discussed. A linear stability analysis is performed to develop an und
erstanding of a primary atomization under this combined action. Threedimen
sional disturbances are considered in order to predict the breakup structur
e (ligaments) observed in  experiments. The fluids are assumed to be invisc
id and incompressible. From the governing equations and the boundary condit
ions, a dispersion relation is derived and analyzed for a single as well as
 two interfaces. Four different regimes have been shown to be possible, bas
ed on the most unstable axial and circumferential wavenumbers. They are (i)
 Taylor mode, (ii) flute mode, (iii) sinuous mode and (iv) helical mode. In
 order to represent the simultaneous action, a characteristic length scale 
is defined and it allows us to compare the deformation length scales in the
 three regimes, viz. Taylor, flute and helical mode using a single length s
cale measure. The dimensionless quantities relevant to this study are Bond 
number representing the ratio of radial acceleration force to the surface t
ension force and Weber number representing the ratio of the aerodynamic for
ce due to the relative velocity to the surface tension
force at each interface.

This study reveals that threedimensional disturbances (helical modes) domi
nate the system behavior under certain (RT mechanism) is significantly mor
e efficient than the traditional way of destabilizing an interface using ax
ial relative velocity (KH mechanism). 


In conclusion, the results of our study open up new avenues for designing a
tomizers to destabilize a liquid sheet by radial motion instead of axial mo
tion. In addition, the onset of transition from absolute instability to con
vective instability, in the Bond number  Weber number space is also
identified.
