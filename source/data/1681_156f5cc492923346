 Dear all,

 Due to repeated requests from girl students to open messes in Himalaya
 during online mess registration for them, we have decided to take a survey
 from the entire students to know the opinion of majority of students.
 Please take a few minutes of your time to fill this form
 
 .

 Please note that we will only be able to discuss this with administration
 if we get responses from atleast 50% of the entire student community.

 The form will be closed by 11:59 PM, 6th September.
