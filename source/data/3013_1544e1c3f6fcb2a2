Please also mention that the course will have programming assignments or
projects based on Matlab. Working knowledge of image processing is a
prerequisite. You need not have taken a formal course but you should have
some practical experience in image processing.

thanks

 Dear CS Councillor,

 Can you please forward this course information to the CS students? I will
 be offering this course in the next semester.

 Computational photography is a relatively new field which is closely
 related to image processing, optics and computer vision. The goal of
 computational photography is to jointly design imaging optics and
 processing algorithms so as to capture more information about the visual
 scene than is possible using only image processing algorithms. For more
 details, see the course flier.

 regards
 Kaushik
