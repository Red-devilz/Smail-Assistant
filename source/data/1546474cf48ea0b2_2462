Dear Rahul Ramesh

Greetings.

Congratulations on an excellent academic journey that you have been carving=
.

Being an IITian, I see you as a potential leader in the society one day.  A=
s you know, the spirit goes beyond academics.  Many successful leaders amon=
g IITians have enriched themselves pursuing passions beyond academics or th=
eir daily routine.  In every one of us, there is this aspect of enthusiasm =
to learn something or the other apart from the routine academics.  Many tim=
es, the initial block has to do with not being able to reach the right plac=
e at the right time to begin learning.  The initial enthusiasm loses steam =
before such a thing happens in our lives.

In order address precisely this,  we have embarked on a program called the =
Leisure Time Activities Program (L-TAP) that facilitates learning at your d=
oor step making learning new extra curricular activities/skills/tools smoot=
h and regular.

This semester saw 1500+ students availing the facility.

While some of you must be availing this, many of you may have a set of such=
 activities in your wish list. I request you to kindly share with us this l=
ist as how we can help you learn such skills or tools that will enrich your=
 lives.

To this effect, we request you to share your thoughts on this through the l=
ink provided to enable us to plan the list of learning modules that we will=
 have ready come the next academic year.
