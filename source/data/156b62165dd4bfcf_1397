To give a brief idea about the sessions, the topics that will be covered
will include sorting and searching, Dynamic programming, Bitmasks, Ternary
Search, Segment Trees, Binary Indexed Trees, Graph algorithms, String
algorithms, Inclusion-Exclusion principle, Combinatorics, Game Theory,
Number Theory, etc.

The main aim of this club is to encourage more participation of students
towards ACM-ICPC

collegiate programming competition. More details about the competition will
be the given during the sessions.
