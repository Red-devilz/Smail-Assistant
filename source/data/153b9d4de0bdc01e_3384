Some additions
The form includes 4th years with some 5th years ED junta (if anyone else
from 5th year who didn't had RG last year can inform me). Also the info can
be provided by anyone interested and who know these people properly and in
case any person is wrongly assigned in a wing (might be due to CCW list
cups) , contact me asap.
