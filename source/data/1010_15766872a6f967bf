Re: Gangasters Water Dispenser at room no:316

Body:
Pathetic.
I dont know if this was the problem with 'not so cleaned' water dispenser
or the the water can or the water. they say it is RO treated and so and so.
what we get is this. that has to be verified in plants.
The cans are also old. and the dispensers doesnt have a locking mechanism
for door, not even a latch. the dispenser near Room# 316 is not usable for
a month or more.

 Concerned secretary look at this issue  and make sure that problem is
 with dispenser cleaning or water tins.
 Hope no similar issues in future...!
