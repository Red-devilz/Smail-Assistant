Hey,

Is there anyone else who lost their cycles recently?

Even I lost my BTWIN (white) a week back. I think the issue should be
escalated to some higher authority. Would like to know Gen-Sec's thoughts
on this. I suggest it would be a good investment to install a camera for
cycle stand, it will certainly be more useful than those 2 cameras
overlooking the same roof.

If anyone has any knowledge of cycle's whereabouts please let me know. Seat
is a little torn, doesn't have mud guards.
Ph no.: 9884299520

Thanks and Regards
