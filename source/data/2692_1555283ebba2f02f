Abstract    Rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves has serious impact on the global climate change and energy consumption. The utilization of solar energy to convert CO 2  into fuels such as methane or methanol could address both the problems simultaneously as well as provide a convenient mean of sustainable energy cycle. The CO 2 reduction can be carried out using electrocatalysis or photocatalysis using a metal or a semiconductor. While we plan to design e_cient electrocatalysts out of transition metal and their alloys, photocatalysts will be tailored from TiO 2 and its composites. To achieve; the desired objective we propose to perform _rst principle electronic structure calculations using densityfunctional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. In this talk we will discuss how these two methodologies can be employed to design appropriate surfaces and i nterfaces for efficient CO 2  adsorption and charge transfer. One of the bottleneck in photo c atalysis is the rapid electronhole recombination processes. Therefore, e_orts will be made; t o reduce it.   All are Welcome  Regards  Ranjit '
