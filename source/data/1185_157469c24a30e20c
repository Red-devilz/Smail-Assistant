Sure. We will open a late submission link tonight at 11 59 pm. Every day of
late submission incurs a penalty of 10% on the marks you obtain. You can
only submit the assignment once (whenever you do). if you do submit
multiple times (before and/or after the deadline) the latest one will be
considered for grading and penalties will be calculated accordingly.C2A0
