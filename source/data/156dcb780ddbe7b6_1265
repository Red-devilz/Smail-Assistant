=E2=AD=90=EF=B8=8F Nylas N1 has 20k stars! =E2=AD=90=EF=B8=8F            =
  Nylas N1 ranked #73 across more than 3.5 million projects.

Hi there =E2=80=94 I'm Michael, the co-founder and CEO of Nylas.

We released  Nylas N1 [https://github.com/nylas/n1] less than a year ago=
 via a small post on Hacker News. Today we're delighted to announce that =
N1 has become one of the top open source projects on GitHub! And it's lar=
gely thanks to you, our fantastic community.

How many stars is 20k?

On GitHub, Nylas N1 is more popular than projects like Ansible, ElasticSe=
arch, HHVM, GoLang, RethinkDB, Kubernetes, Rust, and many more. We're hum=
bled to be included in such a list!

As N1 grows, we're going to be adding more and more premium features to o=
ur paid version of the app, specifically for people using email at work. =
But our roots are always with developers , and N1 will always remain open=
 source.

Thanks again for your support and (as always) let me know if you have any=
 feedback for our team.

--Michael

Co-founder & CEO
