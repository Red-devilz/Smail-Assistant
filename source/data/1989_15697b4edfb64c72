Terry Fox Run 2016 | Sunday, 21st August | 8 AM

Body:
Hello everyone!

Terry Fox was a Canadian athlete who was diagnosed with bone cancer. He set
out on a 5300 km run across Canada, to raise funding for cancer research.
Ever since, Terry Fox runs have been conducted the world over, with the
same goal.

For the 8th time, the Chennai Terry Fox Run will be held on our
campus. On 21st
August 2016, our campus will play host to the legacy of one man  Terry
Fox, and the ideals he stood for. Each year, thousands of participants
finish the run, to raise cancer awareness and funds for cancer research.
However, every year only a few hundred IIT Madras students take part.

This year, our goal is to get as many people to participate as possible.
Together, we can run, and together we can do our part to find the cure for
cancer. Participants can run, walk, cycle or skate through the course.
Registrations are free, and will start at 7 AM and the run starts at 8 AM on
Sunday (21/08/16).

All participants will be given certificates, which are held in high regard
by all companies which come in for placements and internships.

We know that waking up on a Sunday morning can be a mammoth task. If you
would like to be woken up, please fill in this form
 by Friday (19/08/16), and we will
get you up and running for the fight against cancer.

Donations, no matter how small, can be made on the day of the run, or
online. For more information, contact terryfoxrunchennai@gmail.com or call
Mr. Badri at +91 9840744381.

Let us all be a part of this Marathon of Hope. Spread the word, and be
there this Sunday.

Thanks and regards,
