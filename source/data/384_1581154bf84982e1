Dear SP,

TheHLOAD command loads a value from the heap. (Consider it to be a porti
on
of memory that is shared by all the functions.) It takes three arguments,
say r1, l1 and i1, in order. "r1" is the register where we want to store
the loaded value. "l1" is an address in memory. "i1" is that offset from
"l1" from where the value has to be read.
The error means what it says  s1[0] might not be a heap location in your
program. Unless I see your program, I can't help out much with the issue.
If you do not want to share the code publicly, you may mail me the same at
aman.nougrahiya@gmail.com. I will try to find the error in there.

Thanks.
Warmregards,
Aman.
