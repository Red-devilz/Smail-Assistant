Subject:
Re: Gangasters Playing of Music in Ganga

Body:
A few things.

i) Permission was granted to us till 10PM and not 8PM as wrongly stated
in the initial mail. And as our exsocsecs will assure you, our warden is
very supportive of us participating in cultural activities. Also, over the
past couple of years, hostel music practice happened over two months, and
not a few days like this time (sadly). We never had any complaints, since
the inhabitants of Ganga understood that this is a hostel, and certain
compromises had to be made to support mates who are representing the spirit
of Ganga. (GO GANGA!)

ii) We too, just like everyone else have classes in the morning and labs
till the evening (quite surprising? I think not), so practising at these
times is definitely out of the question.

iii) We too have exams, assignments, reports, submissions, deadlines,
internship interviews and what not along with Saarang/Shaastra app
deadlines. Heck, I'm losing count of the number of sleepless nights I've
had for the same reasons. We are taking time out of our schedules for the
hostel to participate in these events, and the least we could have is some
compromise from our hostel mates, instead of relentless cribs. When you
came down and unceremoniously disrupted our sessions and asked us to reduce
the volume, we did. We have been lowering volumes repeatedly since you
guys complained.

iv) @ArjunAR, we've had several people come down to the music room from
their rooms or the quadi to listen to us. All of them said we sound nice.
So I'm going to make the statistically safe option of assuming you are
quite tonedeaf.

v) These incidents are strongly reminding me of my childhood and those
neighbourhood aunties and uncles who used to scream at my friends and I for
playing football and cricket on the streets. Not so desirable nostalgia, to
be blatantly honest.

PS 1  If you have any cribs, please contact me at +919962615051 and let me
know, instead of bursting in like you own the hostel.

PS 2  Again, GO GANGA!

Godspeed
Vakr

 @Venkatraman
 Even if these guys believe you, why should they agree to you? What if the
y
 have equally important priorities for which they're working equally hard,
 and don't give a shit about hostel litsoc glory? :P

 Hi!

 I am staying in Room Number 163, which is right outside the place where
 they are practicing. I know that at times, the sound is annoying  I hav
e
 felt the same way at times too. But I think its also our responsibility 
to
 do everything we can to facilitate students who are representing our hos
tel
 in LitSoc. I know the junta who are practicing this hard personally and
 trust me, they have infinitely many things to do apart from LM and WM. I
 think we can be slightly understanding for a couple of days more, wish t
hem
 luck, and pray that they get out hostel LitSoc glory. I know its an
 inconvenience, but please do bear with it. Close the window and the door
 
 it might help slightly with the sound.

 Cheers!

 Guys,
 This is just to inform you all that I talked to hostel manager abou
t
 the band practice going in the music room. I told him that this is 
very
 disturbing at least for the rooms just above the music room and off
ice.
 They played till 3 in the morning yesterday night which is quite
 disturbing. I asked him to tell these guys ( via Gen.Sec and Lit.Se
c to
 practice in the morning hours (as we all be attending classes) and 
in the
 evening ( 5pm to 8pm). When I asked him what if they played after 8
pm, he
 directly told me to call security and inform warden directly about 
this.
 Hence Music should not be played after 8pm. If it happens, you can
 do the same as well. Call 8080 and warden( his mobile no. is outsid
e office)
