[Seminars] Seminar by Prof. Raju Ramanujan, NTU on July 15 at 3 PM.

Body:
b'     Dear friends,     The Indian Institute of Metals Chennai Chapter and  Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, IIT Madras    Invite you for a talk on   Novel Applications of Magnetic Nanomaterials     Raju V. Ramanujan  School of Materials Science and Engineering  Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798  & Adjunct Professor, Dept. of MME, IIT Madras      Date and Day:     15th July 2016 (Friday)</p Time:          &nb;sp;  3.00 PM  Venue:          &n;bsp; MSB 117  Tea:          &nbs;p;   2:45 PM    Abstract:  A brief overview of our recent work on magnetic nanomaterials for energy, biomedical, transduction and Labona chip applications will be presented. Our projects involve chemical and physical synthesis, advanced characterization and property evaluation of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and magnetpolymer composites for novel, cuttingedge applications such as energy, Bio, transduction and Labonachip.  (a)  Energy:  We have developed  low cost (b)  Bio:  Our development of anticancer drug loaded magnet (core)  polymer (shell) nanoparticles (CNP) for multimodal, targeted and controlled release theranostic disease treatment will be elucidated; our CNP exhibit excellent drug targeting, hyperthermia and controlled drug release for cancer treatment. (c)  Transduction:  Morphing was demonstrated in magnetpolymer composites; the actuation, damage sensing and multi cycle, remote, wireless selfhealing characteristics of these ;smart composites will be highlighted. (c)  Labonachip:  Magnetic fluids have been developed for labonachip applications. The novelty of our work is the use of uniform magnetic fields  for tuning fluid flow.   About the Speaker: Prof. R. V. Ramanujan is a Fellow of the American Society of Materials. He received his Ph.D. in Materials Science from Carnegie Mellon University. He earned his BTech from IIT Bombay. Ramanujan has served as Editor or Editorial Board member of  Nanomedicine ,  Materials Science   and Engineering B , Materials Science and   Engineering C  and  Metallurgical and Materials Transactions . He has served on the Magnetic Materials Committee of TMS (Chair), Awards Committee of TMS, and the Phase Transformations Committee of TMS. Ramanujan was previously employed at Advanced Devices and Materials (USA), University of Birmingham (U.K.), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At NTU, he has received the Nanyang Award for Excellence in Teaching . Ramanujan is an Adjunct Professor at University of North Texas, South China University of Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, University of Mumbai and the JN Centre for Advanced Scientific Research.
