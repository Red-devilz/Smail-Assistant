 Yes. Sir hasn't mentioned the penalty yet. I will meet him tomorrow 
 and update the marks accordingly.

 Hey,
 
 I had earlier got my  CS3310 Compilers Lab  1 reevaluated around 
 19th September. I just wanted to confirm if my marks were updated 
 since moodle isn't updated with the reflected marks.
 Thanks a lot.
 
 Rahul
