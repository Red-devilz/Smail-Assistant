This is for the students graduating this year, other please ignore.

Dear soon-to-be Alumni,

You can collect your *alumni cards* from IITMAA Office (near CCW Office)
today, 22nd July (during office hours) or on AlumNite (at CLT), 23rd July.
This card will be your identity as a member of IITM community once you
graduate and will also be a gateway to amazing privileges that you enjoy as
an alumnus/alumna.

Regards,
