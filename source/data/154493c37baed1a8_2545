<strong>Abstract</strong>:<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) have many attractive pro=
perties like high strength, stiffness and good corrosion resistance. They h=
ave many potential engineering applications like in biomedical devices, spo=
rting goods and defense equipment. However, they
 may exhibit poor fracture resistance which can impede their usage in struc=
tural components. A detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms that =
govern fracture in BMGs remains elusive. This lecture will focus on a cavit=
ation induced failure mechanism
 which has been observed in brittle BMGs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mode I fracture experiments were recently conducted using a=
nnealed Vit-1 (a Zr-based BMG) specimens. It was found that brittle fractur=
e occurs and the fracture surface exhibits several interesting features. Wh=
ile HRSEM pictures show some evidence of nano-scale
 void nucleation close to the original notch front, further away, periodic =
nano-scale corrugations are noticed. Such fractographic features have also =
been reported by other investigators for inherently brittle (like Mg-based)=
 BMGs. Atomistic simulations show
 shear band mediated plastic flow and intense crack blunting &nbsp;in a duc=
tile (Cu-Zr) BMG, whereas brittle fracture by a cavitation mechanism is not=
iced for a brittle (Fe-P) BMG. The latter exhibits several intriguing featu=
res such as a low cavitation stress to
 yield stress ratio and void-insensitive cavitation behavior. These are att=
ributed to nano-scale fluctuations in atomic density that are &nbsp;present=
 in the brittle BMG which give rise to weak regions with low yield strength=
.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Motivated by the above observations, 2D plane strain continuum finite el=
ement analysis of cavitation in a heterogeneous plastic solid containing a =
distribution of weak zones is performed to understand all features pertaini=
ng to nucleation of cavities in
 brittle BMGs. It is found that the presence of weak zones can significantl=
y reduce the critical hydrostatic stress corresponding to onset of cavitati=
on which is controlled uniquely by the local yield properties of the weak z=
ones and the prevailing stress state.
 The volume fraction of weak zones and stress state influence the nature of=
 cavitation bifurcation. The results also show that snap-cavitation may occ=
ur in heterogeneous plastic solids, giving rise to sudden formation of void=
s with finite size, which does not
 happen in homogeneous plastic solids. Continuum simulations of crack initi=
ation under mode-I plane strain, small scale yielding conditions in a heter=
ogeneous plastic solid are also performed and various steps involved in cav=
itation-induced fracture are delineated.</p>
