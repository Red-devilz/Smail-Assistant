Tutorial 2 Question3
by EE13D015 KRISHNA CHAITANYA KOSARAJU  Friday, 9 September 2016, 10:28 AM

Q3. One way of recovering multivariate regression coefficients using
univariate regression is to use orthogonalization. If the dimensions were
orthogonal to begin with, can we independently regress the dependent
variable on each of the dimensions and recover the same coefficients as
multivariate regression? Should we center the data before doing this?
Explain your answer.

Forthe last part. The given answer is yes.

Shouldwe center the data before doing this? Explain your answer.

Butif we center the data, the vector's may no longer be orthogonal.
Therefore we cannot independently regress the dependent variable.C2A0
