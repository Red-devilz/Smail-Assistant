 Hi,

 Quote "so we  decided to celebrate the week after diwali."????? I mean
 with whom did you discuss before coming to this decision? Try to inform
 decisions like this beforehand in the group or try to give the
 responsibility to any other able person if you are not in the institute.

 Phaneendra

 Hi everyone

 Sorry for the late reply.
 As this Diwali was in a weekend, many localities weren't there in
 institute.so we  decided to celebrate the week after diwali.The exact
 details will be intimated soon in the IP.
 Money allocated for Diwali will be spent for informal events(post Diwali
 celebration).

 Hi,
 I thought the decision was taken to organize extra night to
 utilize the residue funds but not to replace the existing thing. Moreover,
 I do see ,in the existing budget 3000 Rs alloted for Diwali. Also, there
 are not two but three festivals mentioned in GBM. PFA.
 Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks.
