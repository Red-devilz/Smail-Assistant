 ABSTRACT

 The high fidelity acquisition and modern processing technology allow the
 applications of Quantitative Seismic Interpretation (or Quantitative
 Interpretation QI) to grow fast in Reservoir Geophysics discipline in E&
P
 Industry for last few years. Integration of data from different disciplin
es
 plays key role in Quantitative Interpretation and consequently field
 development plans by reducing the reservoir uncertainties. Presently, QI
 workflow is being used in every stage of Geophysical activities for field
E2s
 development plan. In exploration, it is used in prospect identification,
 hydrocarbon uncertainty analysis, selection of exploration well locations
 and Probability of Success (PoS) analysis. In appraisal and development
 stages, it is used for fluid and contact analysis, reservoir facies
 distribution, reservoir properties distribution, development well placeme
nt
 and Volumetric & Reserves estimation. Finally, at the production stage,
 integration with geological, petrophysical, geomechanical and reservoir
 engineering data, a Reservoir Geophysicist (QI) would be able to provide
 reservoir continuity, undrained reserves, new potential infill well
 locations and in some cases subsidence prediction as well. In the present
 talk; applications of QI at different stage of geophysical activities in
 field development plan, will be discussed along with some examples from t
he
 projects which I have been associated with in my last 10 years.



 About the Speaker

 Dr Pankaj Tiwari obtained his PhD from Indian Institute of Technology
 Bombay in 2008. Post PhD, he was hired by Shell oil company as Geophysici
st
 for ShellE2s newly established technology hub in Bangalore. He was
 an
 integral part of their Global Center of Expertise. Dr. Tiwari was
 associated with exploration and development projects from Gulf of Mexico,
 Brazil, Nigeria, Canadian Beaufort Sea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia,
 Brunei, Pakistan and North Sea. He carried out several Stochastic and
 Deterministic Seismic Inversions for Reservoir continuity and property
 prediction to help appraisal and development projects. Dr. Pankaj Tiwari
 joined OMV Tunisia in January 2013 on an expatriate assignment, to
 supervise geophysical operations and train the fresh inductees in Petrole
um
 Engineering Department.
