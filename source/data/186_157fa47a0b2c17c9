Instead of randomly forming teams, could you not from teams of people who
are planning to use same language/tools? You can put up a spreadsheet (or a
form if they don't want to publicly share) where we'll give our preferred
language/tool. It will be convenient for the TA's too as you'll get a list
of people without a team.C2A0
