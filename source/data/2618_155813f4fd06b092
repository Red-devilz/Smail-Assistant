Changes @ virgo.

Body:
Dear Users of HPCE space,

Here are some changes @ virgo cluster.

1. In Virgo super cluster, SMT has been enabled. This has increased the num
ber of cores to almost double. The 4096 core cluster will now act as 8192 c
ore machine. As we have increased number of cores, the wait time for jobs i
n the queue has considerably come down. So for up to  32 processors (ppn) y
ou can keep the nodes D 1.  This should be more efficient than asking 2 n
odes with 16 processors per node. If you are looking for  32 processors yo
u should ask for  1 node.

2. It has been decided to create a new logical partition from the parallel 
partition to cater to very large jobs requiring more than 128 cores as ther
e has been demand for such queues. 64 nodes from 192 nodes have been config
ured to run very large jobs. On these nodes 8 new queues have been configur
ed. Now you can use upto 512 processors (see the queue details in the attac
hment). Please send us feedback at hpce@iitm.ac.in. Happy supercomputing.

Warm regards,
Krishna.
