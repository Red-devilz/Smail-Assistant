Hello guys,

The Analytics Club is back this year with its exciting series of sessions
!

Now that the introductory session is over, we are coming up with our first
session  Introduction to R.

R is a language that is very useful in data analysis, especially for
beginners, that is very easy to learn and use. In this session we will get
you started with R touching upon the basic syntax and common functions. We
will also go through some data sets and perform basic operations on them.

Date : 15/09/2016
Day : Thursday
Venue : CRC 101
Time : 9 PM  11 PM

We will be working out everything in R. If you don't have R, Use the
following links to download and install R
 and Rstudio
 before you come to the
session.

Install the following packages in R or R Studio by typing the following
commands:

install.packages("swirl")
install.packages("MASS")

Come with your laptops charged !!
