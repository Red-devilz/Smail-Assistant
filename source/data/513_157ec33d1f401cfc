Hi Mohnish,

 This is Ramnandan, 2016 CS Dual Degree Grad. We're looking to expand our
dev team for our startup Fastnext. Uttej apparently spoke to you about this
and sending out a short writeup on the department groups. Can we get on a
call anytime to discuss this?

Here's the short writeup for your understanding anyways:



What is Fastnext?

 Fastnext is a datadriven recruitment platform backed by a powerful
Machine Learningbased matching engine. The recommendation technology
analyses millions of developer Internet profiles to find the perfect fit
for a company's requirements. We use data science and predictive analytics
to provide hyperpersonalized recruitment.

 We are a startup, which has spun out of IITMadras. WeE2re part of 
the
NASSCOM Startup Warehouse Program (with office space in Tidel Park). We've
gone into sales and are currently working with 22 companies. We had worked
on an edtech product (Quabl) 2 years back before pivoting to our current
pursuit.

What are we looking for?

 As mentioned above, our web crawlers aggregate data from multiple data
bins (LinkedIn, Github, StackOverflow,  HackerRank, SPOJ, etc) and ensure
maximum data about each candidate for a complete overview to be utilised by
the MLbased matching engine.

 We are also currently working on a cuttingedge chatbot interface for the
AI engine that you can talk to E2 either as a recruiter or a candida
te
(Pretty cool, I know :))

 We are looking to expand our development team with enthusiastic junta
looking to be part of a fastpaced highgrowth startup. We are looking for
junta with knowledge of (or willing to quickly pick up):

C2B7      Django

C2B7      Natural Language Processing (for the chatbot under development)

C2B7      Machine Learning

 If you think youE2d be a good fit in our team, do send us your resu
me at
nandparikrish@gmail.com or call me at +919940166031 (IE2m Ramnandan
Krishnamurthy, a recent CS Dual Degree graduate and Cofounder of Fastnext
