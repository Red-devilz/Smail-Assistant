It would be preferable if the student is from IIT or able to apply for DAADIIT Master Sandwich scholarship. The organizers could try to get payment (say 4080h per month  as much paid for HiWi) for one exceptional candidate who could not get one of these scholarships.      About the available position:   Prof. Ajay Harish & other colleagues (Michele & Nanthakumar, both Humboldt scholars) have open student positions at IKM. Enclosed below is the official ad    Link: &nbs;p;       They would prefer a master\'s student(s) in mechanical / aerospace / civil engineering   with a working knowledge of Mathematica .        The student will develop some elements using AceGen and study a problem in one of the novel upcoming areas of mechanics (like biomechanics, 3D printing etc). During the learning process, the student will also develop several codes to create a database of AceGen codes that can be used by all parties. It is also planned that some of these could be handed out in the workshopconference ( www.rcm2016.unihannover.de ) that have been planned for later this year or early next year.
