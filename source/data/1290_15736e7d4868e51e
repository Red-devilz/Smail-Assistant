Fun With GDs | 18-9-16 (Sunday) 7:30PM | Himalaya Lawns

Body:
Greetings from the Oratory Club,

The first Oratory Club event for the semester is here!

Fun with GDs is a casual event where all you have to is come down to
Himalaya Lawns before/after your dinner and have a 15 minute group
discussion on the most frivolous and wacky topic!

If GD tips(following each discussion) from the best in insti is not
incentive enough, know that your discussions will be over ice cream. Yes,
we have a stock of 100 ice creams ready with us!

Don't miss this. Himalaya Lawns, this Sunday between 730 pm and 9 30
pm.

Regards,
Anurag Agarwal
Oratory Club Convener
