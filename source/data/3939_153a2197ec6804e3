Re: Gangasters Regarding mosquito net for my room - 414

Body:
The HHS has been telling me since the last semester that he will be getting
the wider nets for the top floor rooms.
I just hope they come before the end of his tenure.


Thanks and Regards

 The HHS already informed me few days back that he is going to get wider
 mosquito nets for the front windows of top floor rooms very soon. Any
 updates, HHS??

 I believe this mail concerns the General Secretary of our hostel. It has
 become very painful for me to sleep during the night due to the insane
 number of mosquitoes swarming my room. I would be very thankful if a
 mosquito net is fitted to the front window of my room soon.


 Thank you.
