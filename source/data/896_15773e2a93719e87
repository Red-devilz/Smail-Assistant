Yes, it will work with java8.

@All: In case you do not have java8, here are the steps to obtain your own
miniIR interpreter (compatible with the java version present on your
system):

	 Unjar miniIR.jj:C2A0C2A0C2A0 jar xf miniIR.jj
 	 Remove all the class files from the unjarred directory
 	 Compile:C2A0C2A0C2A0 javac PgInterpreter.java
 	 jar the contents again:C2A0C2A0C2A0 jar cvfm miniIR.jar MANIFEST.
