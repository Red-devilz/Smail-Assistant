Hey,

We are taking part in the Theatricals competition conducted by Evam in
collaboration with Stella Maris College. We are putting up "While The Auto
Waits" by O Henry, to be directed by Gopesh Bajre.

Auditions for all the parts are open and you guys are invited and
encouraged to turn up. Do come and call your friends too.

The second round of auditions have been scheduled on the 24nd September
(i.e. today) SAC entrance at7:30 PM. A copy of the script has been
attached.

Here's hoping to see tons of enthusiasm from you guys.

Cheers

Thespian Conveners.
