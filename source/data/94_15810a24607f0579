I generated a miniRA code for a program. It parses according to the miniRA
grammar. However, when I run the program using the given jar, I get the
following error 
ERROR: line 436: The second operand of HLOAD must point to the heap.
Please check near the following source code:
C2A0 HLOADC2A0C2A0 s0C2A0 s1C2A0 0 (line:436 col:19)

I am not able to understand why I'm getting this error. Also, the meaning
of the error is not clear. Can I know what it means?

C2A0
