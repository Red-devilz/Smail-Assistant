Hi,

All of batches D,E,F,G,H,I will have their gd lab tomorrow (along with
Adhiyaman who missed lab class last time) . You will be doing the
experiment you missed due to nozzle breaking apart. From tomorrow, Sir is
gonna be there. Please make sure you don't come to the lab and then ask
"which lab are we doing?"
