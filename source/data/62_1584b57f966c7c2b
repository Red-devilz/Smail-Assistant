b'       Title: Functional Biomimetic Materials  From Rational Design to Applications in Biomaterials & Biosensor Technology  Date: 08112016 (Tuesday)  Time: 03:00 PM  Venue:   Newton Hall, Department of Applied Mechanics (1st floor, Aerospace Building)  Speaker:  Prof. Ian A. Nicholls ( Linnaeus University & Uppasala University) Sweden     ABSTRACT:    The recognition capabilities of molecularly imprinted materials are being successfully exploited in a growing number of application areas [1]. Material morphology can be critical for timedependent application areas such as separation, sensing and catalysis, and even for interaction with components of varying size, e.g. as found in biological matrices.    Accordingly, strategies for the design and synthesis of imprinted materials with both high fidelity imprints and suitable morphologies is required. We are currently exploring the use of hierarchical material architectures derived from sacrificial soft scaffolds such as liquid crystalline media in conjunction with molecularly imprinted polymerization reactions [2,3]. Recent progress with these fabrication strategies in the production of nanofibers and ordered mesoporous materials shall be presented, along with examples of the application of these materials in quartz crystal microbalance sensing studies, e.g.  [4]. Recent work using macromolecular surface based imprinting for generating biomaterials capable of attenuating the complement cascade in whole blood shall also be presented [5].
