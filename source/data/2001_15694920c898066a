Re: Gangasters Flag

Body:
Dear Amol,

I totally understand that it is a very important thing and that whoever put
the flag there should have been more careful. And I appreciate the fact
that you took a notice of it.

But, I feel that in addition to putting the mail and asking the secretaries
to come and remove it, you can remove it yourself as it is really close to
your room and takes less time than typing a mail.

Its kind of ironic that you could send a mail to bring it to everyone's
notice, but never took the responsibility to remove it yourself.

PS: I think a secretary lives right in your wing, doesn't he

PPS: No offence to anyone. Correct me if I am wrong
