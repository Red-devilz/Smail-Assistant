hello guys!!!

As the hostel night is too close, we need to get the RG posters printed
tomorrow.
We need the *edited version* of the RG forms(writeupin doc format)
from the *pre
final years and passouts* by *tonight 10 pm(06/04/2016)*.Otherwise the RGs
(without writeup) will be put up only with photos.

Please send the writeups to
*ee14b110@smail.iitm.ac.in <ee14b110@smail.iitm.ac.in>    *or
*ch14b085@smail..iitm.ac.in <http://iitm.ac.in>*


Please note that  we were repeatedly intimating the passouts and pre-final
years to send their edited version of the RG forms as we didn't want the
RGs to be printed in the last moment.

For any discrepanies,call 9940509873 or 9176492137
