CS3310 - Compilers Lab 1 evaluation

Body:
Hi,

I am Rahul, and I had a couple of queries regarding the Compilers Lab 1 
evaluation. I had missed a single print statement in my final 
submission, due to which none of the programs that parsed, printed out 
correctly.
Is it possible to get it reevaluated after changing the code? What 
would be a good time for the same since I believe, I am required to 
show you the changes in person. I'd prefer Monday maybe around 4:30 but 
any other time should be fine too.
Thanks.


Rahul Ramesh
