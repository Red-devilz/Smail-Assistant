Fwd: Virtual memory on real OSes

Body:
b'       Good question Rajat.    In earlier versions of Linux there was a limit to the amount of memory a user space program could have. Similar to what we see in xv6.    Since pentium pro however there is a paging mode called PAE which allows more than 4gb to be addressed.      Recent linux kernels use pae to support huge user processes ... in the order of 2^48 bytes...

Is this also true for OSes like Windows/Linux running on 32 bit machines?  If not, how is their virtual memory scheme different that solves this problem?
