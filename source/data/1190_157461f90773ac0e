we strongly believe that every child can and must attain an excellent
education. We believe that it will take a movement of leaders across
sectors

with the idealism, belief, skills and commitment to end educational
inequity and put their students on a different life path.  Short Term
Change
In the shortterm, through our Fellowship program, we provide an
opportunity to IndiaE2s brightest and most promising individuals, fr
om the
nationE2s best universities and workplaces, to serve as fulltime te
achers
to children from lowincome communities in some of the nationE2s mos
t
underresourced schools. Through this experience of teaching in classrooms
and working with key education stakeholders like students, principals, and
parents, our Fellows get exposed to the grassroots realities of IndiaE2
s
education system and begin to cultivate the knowledge, skills, and mindsets
necessary to attain positions of leadership in the education system and
identify their role in building a larger movement for equity in education.

Long Term Change
In the longterm, we engage these leaders, our Alumni, and support this
growing community to advocate for change. Our Alumni work in diverse roles
within the education sector, as teachers, teachertrainers, school
principals, curriculum designers, and education policy researchers, as well
as in the ecosystem surrounding and supporting the education sector, as
journalists, lawyers, health experts, entrepreneurs, and corporate leaders,
all with a shared purpose to build a broad peopleE2s movement for
educational equity that will accelerate progress towards that day when all
children in India have the opportunity to attain an excellent education so
that we, as a nation, can find our light and our true potential.E2B
