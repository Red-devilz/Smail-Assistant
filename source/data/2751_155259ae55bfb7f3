 Reasons for this :
 1. The confusion in the perception of the name
 A lot of us may confuse it with the other SAC (Students Activities Centre

 Reasons against this :
 1. It has retained this name from more than 20 years
 2. Also a lot of other colleges have adapted this name too from IITM

 Please reply if you would like to add to any reasons for or against this
 change :)

 Hope you guys are enjoying your vacations F0FA
