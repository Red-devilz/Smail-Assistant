Hi!

As part of our constant effort to reach out to students and carve out a
niche for ourselves, the Student Affairs Council has decided to embark on a
rebranding exercise. As the first step, we have decided to rename ourselves
to a name that we think conveys our duties and responsibilities to the
General Student Body without any confusion.

The Student Affairs Council is now the Student Legislative Council, IIT
Madras*!:D

Cheers!
Venkataraman
