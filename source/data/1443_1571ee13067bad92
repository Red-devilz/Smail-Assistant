Freshie JAM | September 14th | 6PM | CRC 101

Body:
Hello all,

Greetings from the Oratory Club!

Hope all of you are having a great semester! With quiz week almost over, we
are excited to announce our first set of events! While our regular club
sessions will kickoff soon, we'd like to greet our freshies with a few
special events this week. We present you our first event the Freshie JAM
[Just A Minute]!

If you haven't heard already, if there's one event you don't want to miss
out on as a freshie, it's the Freshie JAM. If plagiarism, grammatical
errors, gesticulation, jumping the gun, stammering, changing of pace and
other time wasting tactics are, according to you, the Seven Deadly
Sins, then you surely do belong here. For the ones who do not know the
rules of the game but would love to participate, come along! Bring along
some enthu and you'll surely have a great time. Come down to CRC 101 at 6
PM on September 14th.

If this much convincing hasn't done the job, here's one more reason why you
should mark your calendars. We've got a great moderator Udith. JAM is one
among the many things he excels at and we can assure you that he'll more
than inspire you to keep JAMmin'!

While only freshies will be participating, students of all batches can
attend the event and enjoy some JAM because JAM's always fun.

Regards,

Convenors,

Oratory Club 201617.
