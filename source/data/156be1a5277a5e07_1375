Hi All,

We are conducting Linux installfest on *27th August (Saturday)* at *2 PM*
in *ESB 127*.

Please fill this <https://goo.gl/forms/7bOHMf3L0OXVxF7C3> form if you are
attending.

To save time during the installfest, we request you to make a bootable USB
pendrive.

To do so, go to this link <http://10.21.106.182> to download the
appropriate Ubuntu ISO file and follow the instructions therein to make a
bootable USB pendrive.

Since the link provided is intranet, the download rate should be faster.

 If you are not sure which ISO file to use, choose the 16.04 (x64 bit).


*Venue : ESB 127*

*Date : 27 August 2016*
*Time : 2 PM*
