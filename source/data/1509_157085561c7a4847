Ball Badminton Practice

Dear all,

We would like to resume Ball Badminton practice in our campus. For this, we
require all the Ball Badminton enthusiasts to fill this form
.

We are planning to hire a coach depending on the interest shown by the
students and an interhostel tournament will also be conducted during this
academic year.

Thank you!
