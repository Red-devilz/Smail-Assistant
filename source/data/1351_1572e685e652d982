 Yes I agree that monkey free ganga is priority but
 The Worth is of Product not of Idea.
 So we want some ideas with solutions which we can be implemented along
 with some project members.

 Keeping monkeys away from the dispenser areas and staircases is the
 need of the hour. Let's think about something to shoo them off withou

 physically harming them, Some Alak people have plastic snakes to scar

 off. :P

 Hi Guys,

 I hope everyone would have started studying by now :D
 This year we are going to do something different as compared to
 past years and that will be to Introduce projects at hostel
 level which can be practically implemented in the hostel for
 the benefit of all the students. We have the budget to fund 3 sm
all scale
 projects and I already have ideas for 2 of them.

 Now my motive of sending this mail during quiz week is that
 during this time only we think about all the problems of the uni
verse and
 discuss about everything except studies :P

 So if you come up with any of the problem which can be solved by
 technology and that can be implemented in our hostel then you
 can post in this thread during the next 10 days. The work on
 the project will start from 20th Sept.

 All the Best for Quizzes...!!!
