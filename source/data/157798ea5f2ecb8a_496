Sangam and Saarang are planning to host a set of *Gaming* events in the
institute this year.

In order to make sure that we appeal to the maximum number of gamers
possible, we would like to conduct a survey which would determine the most
popularly played *e-sports* in the institute.

Please fill in your e-sport preferences in this short Google form
