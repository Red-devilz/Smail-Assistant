Dear all,

Due to repeated requests from girl students to open messes in Himalaya
during online mess registration for them, we have decided to take a survey
from the entire students to know the opinion of majority of students.
Please take a few minutes of your time to fill this form
<https://docs.google.com/a/smail.iitm.ac.in/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLZcvcdFHYHmUPRaqAEeCerB5C658GrjluXMrJuRa2NyagzA/viewform>
.

*Please note that we will only be able to discuss this with administration
if we get responses from atleast 50% of the entire student community.*

The form will be closed by *11:59 PM, 6th September.*
