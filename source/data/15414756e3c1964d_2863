Guys,
This is just to inform you all that I talked to hostel manager about the
band practice going in the music room. I told him that this is very
disturbing at least for the rooms just above the music room and office.
They played till 3 in the morning yesterday night which is quite
disturbing. I asked him to tell these guys ( via Gen.Sec and Lit.Sec to
practice in the morning hours (as we all be attending classes) and in the
evening ( 5pm to 8pm). When I asked him what if they played after 8pm, he
directly told me to call security and inform warden directly about this.
Hence Music should not be played after 8pm. If it happens, you can do the
same as well. Call 8080 and warden( his mobile no. is outside office)
