Hello everyone,

Greetings from *CFI* !!

We are a bunch of third years working on a fold-able and portable modular
housing startup. We are looking for sophomores who are interested in
structural engineering and building technology.

The use case which we are working on is Disaster Management and
Rehabilitation. We are currently in the prototyping stage. This will be a
great learning experience for people interested in tech startups. Based on
performance you might be considered for a long-term position.
