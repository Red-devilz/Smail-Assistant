About the workshop:

There is nothing worse than seeing someone we care about going through
something difficult and wanting to help but not knowing how to! Recognizing
the fact that many people out there want to help and there are many others
who want our help, Saathi and Medall Behavioral Health Services are
organizing an E2On Being a Helper' workshop to help you recognize si
gns of
people with depression, suicidal intentions and equipping you with
techniques for intervention.We rise by lifting up others, so sign up and,
show you care!


The workshop will be limited to the first 30 registrants. However, thereE2
s
no need for worry. We will be conducting more :D



Warm regards,
Saathi team
