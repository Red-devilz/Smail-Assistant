Hi,

We hope to learn a lot over this course too. Regarding the confusion, 
her name is Meghana and you are referring to the same person.

 Hi Rahul!
 
 Thanks for your mail. I am quite impressed by the logical thinking 
 and speed of your group. Keep up the good work. Future assignments 
 (the main ones at least) will be more involved.
 
 I guess there is some confusion. Are we talking about Meghana or 
 Aparna? Are they both same?
 
 Hoping to have a good learning experience with both the groups.
 
 Thanks.
 Aman.
