Body:
Hi

We are starting off with our LItSoc journey today (15/09/2016) at 9:00
pm through our LitSoc Intra hostel event ANtakshri. To add, we are
having LitSoc points this time for Intra hostel events. There is a minimum
participation to be achieved (~50) along with preset rules and we need
support from you all so come off for this event.Those who came last
semester for this might know the fun we had in this and the interaction
involved along with the endless dancing.

Do come!!


Regards
