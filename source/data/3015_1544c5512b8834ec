Thank you!

Body:
Dear all,

E2BMy tenure as Branch Councillor has come to an end and I would like
 to
officially hand over my charges to Mohnish today.

Thank you everyone for trusting and giving me an opportunity to serve both
students and department. Also, a great thanks to all my friends who stood
by me at every point during my term.

Past one year had been filled with ups and downs and it was one of the best
years of my life. I have learnt a lot through out my tenure and the
experience had shaped me into what I am today. It was indeed a memorable
journey and I have enjoyed every moment of it. It wouldn't have been
possible without the support from you.

E2BI would like to thank Prof. Krishna Moorthy Sivalingam, Prof E2
BDr. C.
Chandra Sekhar (Board of Placement Member from CSE Department) and Prof P
Sreenivasa Kumar for their constant support and encouragement.

I wish Mohnish and his team best of luck.


E2BE2BThanks,
Vamshi
