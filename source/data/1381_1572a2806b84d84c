 I don't think it's as straightforward as it sounds. 46.5% students. have
 responded saying NO.. So, there is no clear verdict from GSB. The SLC will
 have to look into the "reasons" provided and have to decide whether the
 people who have voted on either side have any valid points or they are
 merely moralistic.

 Anyway.. @Pradhyumna. I already raised this point regarding changing the
 CGPA criterion for students from weaker sections to pursue B.Tech(Hons). I
 have also submitter the RTI proof to Speaker and Social Equity Committee.
 Please look into it and request the SLC to take it up soon.
