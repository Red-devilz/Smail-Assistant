Hey all,

The Writing Club is super-excited to be announcing the movie session of the
semester.

The screening will take place *TOMORROW, 15th Oct 2016 *at *CLT *and will
start at *6.30 sharp*. The movie will be 1 and 1/2 hour long and we will
break for dinner before we get back to a short writing session. This
session will be longer than the usual ones and I hope that will not be of
inconvenience to anyone around.

We are still not decided on the movie, but we sure will screen something
beautiful and inspiring to choke out the writers in you.

Hoping to see you all there,
Gerleo and Aparna
