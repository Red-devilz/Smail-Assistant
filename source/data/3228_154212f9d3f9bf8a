Subject:
Re: Gangasters Playing of Music in Ganga

Body:
No one is throwing anyone out of this group, I assure you that. I m Ganga
Google group manager.

This spamming has to stop now. No more mails on this thread or else i have
to change the group settings and then all the mails on this group will be
moderated by the manager. I Dont wanna do that but if this goes on I will.

This thing is getting out of hand. This group is open to the group members
for a reason. Please do not mail anything irrelevant/stupid to this group
anymore.

Hi!

Just to strike a balanced note here. Let's all be nice and courteous and
not indulge in personal attacks. It's wrong for anyone to be thrown out of
this group (though I really understand the emotions behind the demand).

Let him tell that for him, Ganga is just a hostel. We will show him that
for us, all students living in Ganga are Gangasters and are one of our own,
and that despite what arguments we have amongst each other, we will care
for all. Please do not throw anyone outside this group. All of us are
better than that  we needn't stoop that low.

Cheers!

 Remove him, please. If Ganga is nothing more than just a hostel for him,
 the proceedings on this group shouldn't matter to him. Such oblivious
 behaviour

 Hi,

 Sorry guys, I don't intend to spam this thread but this is too much.

 As the hostel who has consistently placed in the top positions in al
l
 music competitions and with highly qualified members (Who don't need
 certificates to prove their credibility, since they're actually gett
ing
 paid to pursue music), we sincerely apologize for helping Ganga win 
all
 sorts of competitions with our "poor skills in music". As a socalle
d
 musician yourself, I didn't expect that one could go so low and pers
onal in
 some issue like this, which can be settled peacefully (Which we have
 tried,
 but to no avail, as you can see). We are being diplomatic and polite
 (Trying to respect someone older and more experienced than us) and y
ou
 throw replies at us such as "Just to prove that my claim is not as
 hollow as your head I have sent one of my certificates to your perso
nal
 mail. Now, you may suck that rat's posterior or frontal part as you
 prefer." Being someone senior to us, we expected someone more mature
. But
 no, that isn't the case.

 Anyway, we'll stop playing our "terrible music" by Sunday, so you ca
n
 peacefully study then or do whatever it is that you do. Hence, I req
uest
 you to please stop spamming this group with more thinly veiled perso
nal
 insults at someone you don't know and can't appreciate. Thank you so
 much
 for adjusting with us, it's really generous of you!

 I hope that this issue is settled now. You could talk to us
 personally (We'll be in the music room!) if we're again irritating y
ou, and
 we'll try our best not to. Thanks!

 @rakesh vkr I see that your ability to read is worse than your
 skills in music. Rest your case and stop annoying people with your
 incessant practice.

 @arjunar grow up please. You're being a crying baby here.

 PS  you sent me a participation certificate in your school annual
 day. LOL.

 I rest my case. And am going to ignore any more replies on this
 thread and blissfully pretend you don't exist.

 +1 to Ravi. Even I never heard of such issues being raised.

 I have no connection into music but their's was pretty decent to
 hear. Their volume level was pretty reasonable and you can't ask
 them to
 play music like murmuring. If someone is very good at music, why
 can't you
 just participate in the hostel team? Or atleast guide them to pl
ay
 properly? Openly criticizing says that you have no feel for host
el at all,
 try encouraging man. You need not cheer all the way during their
 participation, atleast adjust for very few days.

 @Rakesh Vakr, All the hostels participate and hence practice.
 Hence changing hostel might not help him. Probably he should sta
y outside
 campus himself without any authorities involving.

 If Ganga is nothing to you more than a hostel, your certificates
 are nothing more than a paper.

 @arjunar Thanks for your opinion, but I assure you we do not
 give a rat's posterior end about it. We're pretty convinced the
 issue isn't
 with our music, par Kanpur mein kuch problem hai. I call bluff 
on your
 claims of you being a musician yourself, because a true musicia
n wouldn't
 berate another's efforts. I maintain that you're either tonede
af or that
 you are hallucinating the "music that sucks".
 The world does not revolve around you, and certainly, neither
 does Ganga hostel.

 This direct offensive assault on the quality of the Ganga music
 team is really depressing, as we want the hostel members to be 
one big
 united family (not that we are taking it one bit seriously). Yo
u really do
 not seem to fit in here. Instead of all of us going elsewhere, 
why don't
 you request for a change of hostel? That's a more feasible solu
tion, and a
 winwin situation for us.

 Thanks, don't come again
