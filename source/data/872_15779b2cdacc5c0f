I did not know what it meant but thats what I wanted to be. It was like my father saying he wanted me to be an engineer. During college I tried to sell washing machines to garages unsuccessfully, ran Quark successfully, joined and nearly quit Infosys 3 times to start my own business, finally quit Infosys(while I ran 5% of their business) to start Bangalore Labs. Raised venture capital and sold the company in 2002. At 32, I had completed the first innings of my life.  Post a corporate career, I started a childrens library for middle class children, a social enterprise before the name was coined, then a not for profit to improve libraries in slums and government schools, started restaurants, made angel investments, sat on for profit and not for profit boards and got a different perspective on life. At 40, I had completed the second innings.  I am now actively running a network of preschools and schools for Rural India. We are one of the larger players in the country and are respected amongst the impact community for the potential impact we can make in education. In this 3 rd &nbsp;innings, I am faced with a completely different set of challenges.  In my talk I intend to share through anecdotes the glamor and the heartbreaks of corporate life, entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and what it means to change the world.
