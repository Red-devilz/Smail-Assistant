 Hi Guys,

 I hope everyone would have started studying by now :D
 This year we are going to do something different as compared to past year
s
 and that will be to Introduce projects at hostel level which can be
 practically implemented in the hostel for the benefit of all the
 students. We have the budget to fund 3 small scale projects and I already
 have ideas for 2 of them.

 Now my motive of sending this mail during quiz week is that during this
 time only we think about all the problems of the universe and discuss abo
ut
 everything except studies :P

 So if you come up with any of the problem which can be solved by
 technology and that can be implemented in our hostel then you can post
 in this thread during the next 10 days. The work on the project will
 start from 20th Sept.

 All the Best for Quizzes...!!!
