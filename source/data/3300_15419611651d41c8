 Hi,

 It would help me and everyone if you could make clear which rooms are
 included in a particular wing. Some people this that there are 16 room
 wings while others think that there are 32 room wings. So if you would be
 so kind as to give a clear description of the wings and rooms included in
 them, it would be of help to everyone.

 Hoping for your quick response.

 Thanks and regards,
 Dhruv Jain.
