 Dear all,

 Greetings from Centre for Innovation! Hope you all had a great vacation.

 The club activities in CFI have grown enormously over the past couple
 of years, and have increased both in variety and dimension. In order to
 ensure smooth functioning, every club/dept. has a set of coordinators who
 form the organizing team along with the heads.

 Applications for posts of coordinators for  all clubs and organizing
 teams are now open. Interested ones are requested to fill this form
 
  by 11:59PM, 10th Aug'16.

 PS: This will involve not just work, but a lot of learning. Second years
 (and above) are strongly encouraged to apply!

 
 Centre for Innovation,
 Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
