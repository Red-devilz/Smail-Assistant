Body:
Sorry to interrupt your "Serious" discussions guys, but can't stop myself
from advising both of you peoples.

Being a final year student, this is the first time I had witnessed this
issue! , in fact a valid one. here I present you a solution:

1.Why not keep your earphones/headphones on and listen to your favorite
music(which we always do :D ) during the night time when they are playing
and try to sleep if their music really sucks. (Am I rude? maybe, but Am not
when compared to these responses here :p )

2.We just can't ask them to stop before 8pm/10pm for our own sake(we being
selfish?), as they are practicing for hostel, i.e for us! ,in return see
what they are getting.


P.S: Admire them or else ignore them but don't degrade them.
