 In the Linux kernel source code, all system call implementations (the
 function invoked by the trap handler) start with sys_

 All kernel functions along with their virtual address in the currently

 $ cat /proc/kallsyms

  Can you find out the number of system calls that your Linux kernel
 supports. (Use tools like sed or grep)
  Search in the list for your favourite system calls.
