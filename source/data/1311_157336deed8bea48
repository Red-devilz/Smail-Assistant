Gangasters Sports Equipment

Body:
Hey!

The following are now available at the watchman's desk:

   1. Football
   2. Cricket Bat, Balls and Stumps
   3. Badminton Racquet and Shuttles
   4. TT Bats and Balls
   5. Volleyball
   6. Basketball

The only way you can use them is by giving your ID card to the watchman.
Once you return the equipment, your ID card shall be returned. Even if
something is broken, please return it to the watchman. This is to ensure
that we have a proper count of everything and once these supplies are used
up, I shall get more stuff. So, please use them carefully.

Regards

Kaushik
