Two Minute Video Minutes of Meetings - September 2016

Body:
Hi!

Have you ever felt that it is painful to go through SLC Minutes of
Meetings?

Have you ever wished to get to know just the salient features of the
policies that your representatives are making?

If yes, welcome to the Video Minutes of Meetings of the Student Legislative
Council!

As part of our efforts to bring the Student Legislative Council closer to
students, the Speaker's Committee has decided to launch two minute videos
that explain SLC proceedings of a particular month to students. Students
who are interested to get a broad over view of what SLC is upto can now get
that information in just a couple of minutes.

Please find below the link to the Video MoM of September 2016. This two
minute video gives you the broad overview of the work done by SLC till the
end of September.

Do go through the video and feel free to let us know what you feel!

Cheers!
Venkataraman
