Body:
b'          Please announce   ______________   This is an invitation for thesecond seminar of Mr. Rajeev R. Tripathi (Ph.D. Student in DoMS):    The details are as follows:     Title:  " Partition Function Games with Stochastic Payoffs "   Date: April 15, 2016 (Friday)   Time: 2:00 pm   Venue: DoMS110, DoMS Building    Abstract     In this research, we study stability incooperative games with font stochasticity and externalities . Traditionally, the cooperative gameliterature assumes that the payoff to a coalition isdeterministic,and&nb;sp;isindependent of the coalition structure. These assumptions are relaxed in stochastic cooperative games and c ooperative games with ext ernalities , respectively. In the literature, theseclasses of games are studied independently.  In many real situations, like preelectoral coalition formation, stochasticity and externalitiescoexist.We propose a theoretical framework to analyzestability of coalition structuresinsucha situation.Our model uses the partition function form representation, but the function is defined to be a random variable. We assume that the distribution of payoff to a coalition in a more refined partition first order stochastically dominates the distribution of payoff to the same coalition in a less refined partition. We introduce a notion of stability and propose a newsolution concept, called foresighted nucleolus. We show that foresighted nucleolus always exists, but it may not be unique. We also present a computational method to compute the solution concept. _____________      R K Amit, PhD</font   Assistant Professor   Department of Management Studies   Indian Institute of Technology Madras   Chennai 600 03   Phone: +91442257 4575    '
