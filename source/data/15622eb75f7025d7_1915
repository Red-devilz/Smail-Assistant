Speaker: William K. Moses Jr. (CS12D020)

Time: 4:30 pm - 5:30 pm (note the slightly unusual time)
Venue: BSB 361

Abstract:
Load balancing is a common problem in multiple domains. The version that we=
 are interested in is where a load balancer must allocate process requests =
to servers such that the number of requests (load) on each server is minimi=
zed. The theoretical framework to analyze this is called the balls-in-bins =
model where process requests are denoted by balls and servers are denoted b=
y bins.

The greedy algorithm Greedy[d] of Azar et al. places each ball by probing d=
 > 1 random bins and placing the ball in the least loaded of them. It ensur=
es a maximum load that is exponentially better than the strategy of placing=
 each ball uniformly at random. Vocking showed that a slightly asymmetric v=
ariant, Left[d], provides a further significant improvement. However, this =
improvement comes at an additional computational cost of imposing structure=
 on the bins.

We present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called Fir=
stDiff[d] that combines the simplicity of Greedy[d] and the improved balanc=
e of Left[d]. The key idea in FirstDiff[d] is to probe until a different bi=
n size from the first observation is located, then place the ball. Although=
 the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show t=
hat FirstDiff[d] requires only d probes on average per ball (in both the st=
andard and the heavily-loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no gr=
eater than either that of Greedy[d] or Left[d]. More importantly, we show t=
hat FirstDiff[d] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by Left[=
d] in both the standard and heavily-loaded settings. We further provide a t=
ight lower bound on the maximum load up to O(log log log n) terms. We addit=
ionally give experimental data that FirstDiff[d] is indeed as good as Left[=
d], if not better, in practice.
