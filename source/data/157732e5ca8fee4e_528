Dear All,

Being an IITian is a matter of pride. Right from our family and friends to
the country as a whole, we are respected as a creed. But even the best of
us may find ourselves overwhelmed by challenges life throws at us. These
challenges may be academic or personal. In the event of finding yourself at
crossroads that seemingly lead nowhere, please remember that your *Mitr* is
here to show you the way. As the saying goes, a friend in need is a friend
indeed.

Be it *exam stress*, *concerns about* your* future*, *inter-personal
relationships* within and outside campus *or  anything else* that is
weighing you down, do not hesitate to reach out.
