b'     Dear all,     This week Mathematicscolloquium will be given byProf. Agnieszka Wylomanska ( Wroclaw University of Technology,Poland)   Please find the details below        Date/  </span: Thursday, 31 st  March, 2016   Time/  : 3:00 p.m.  to  4:00 p.m.  Venue/ <span styleD"fontsize: 16pt;"   : Madhava Hall (HSB 357), 2 nd Floor, Department of Mathematics.  Speaker/    </span  : &n;bsp; Dr. hab . inz . Agnieszka Wylomanska     &nbsp;        ( Faculty of Pure and Applied Mathematics,;      &n;bsp;         Hugo Stein haus Center, Wroclaw University of Technology, Poland)        Title/    : span Anomalous diffusion models as tools to real data description        Abstract: diffusion type processes. However, in the exhibition of some real market data ( like val ues . Moreover, in the case of financial data, the assumption of normality is often unsatisfied . In such cases the popular Vasicek model, that is a mathematical system describing  the evolution of interest rates based on the OrnsteinUhlenbeck process, seems  not to be applicable. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach based on process distribu tion &nb;sp; and  subdiffusion &nb;sp;systems that demonstrate such characteristic behavior. The probability density function  of the proposed process can be described by a Fokker Planck type equation and therefore it can be examined as an extension of&n;bsp; the basic OrnsteinUhlenbeck  model. In this paper, we propose the parameters  estimation method and calibrate the subordinated Vasicek model to the interest rate data .         &n;bsp;  " All are invited..."
