Professional Card Game (Contract Bridge) in LTAP

Body:
Hello all,

Greetings from the Bridge Club. Have you ever played a card game? I think
we all did at some point in time, may be with our friends in the hostel or
with family during vacations. Have you ever thought of playing a card game
tournament? We present to you Contract Bridge, an internationally
acclaimed professional card game.

Contract Bridge is a tricktaking card game similar to Spades &
Hearts played by 4 players in a team of 2. The 2 players of a team are
partners & they sit opposite to each other. The game consists of several
deals, progressing through four phases. Initially, the cards are dealt to
the players & then they auction or bid to take the contract specifying
the number of tricks their partnership will receive. The cards are then
played & deal is scored based on the number of tricks taken.

Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and
with friends at home, making it one of the world's most popular card game.
The interesting fact is that most of the top players representing India in
international tournaments are IIT alumnus.

Contract bridge is a mind game & will definitely excite all the puzzle
enthusiasts
