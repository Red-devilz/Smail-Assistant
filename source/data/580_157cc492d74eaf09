 Hi!

 The Financial Accountability Committee is a Senate approved body that is
 tasked with conducting investigations into financial malpractices by
 students. Directly reporting to the Board of Students through the Dean

 their application to speaker@smail.iitm.ac.in by the 15th of October. T
he
 application process shall be followed by an interview and finally,
 ratification by the Student Legislative Council.

 4. Differentiate between Establishment A, Establishment B and Warden's
 funds.
