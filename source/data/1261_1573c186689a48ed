Q10 and Submission folder size
by CS14B061 RAHUL RAMESH  Sunday, 18 September 2016, 11:48 AM

I had a couple of queries regarding the assignment.

1)C2A0My final submission has a size of around 12MB( the CandC data al
one
contributes 8MB), while the upper limit for a submission file on moodle is
2MB. Any suggestions on how to submit the files?

2)Q10 asks us to "Design and implement the Bayesian Spam filter". Are we
allowed to use libraries for the same, or the does the question imply that
we implement the algorithms from scratch?

Thanks.
