Application: We will inform your students within  weeks after the reception of your nomination by email about the online application procedure. Further information is available at   2. Students will be asked to fill in the online application and print out the application form. This form has to be signed by the home university exchange coordinator as well as the students and should be sent by email to overseas@intl.kit.edu along with  a. a proof of German knowledge (and/or proof of English knowledge if the students plan on taking Englishtaught courses at the KIT) b. a Learning Agreement (list of courses)  c. a current transcript of records by the above mentioned deadline.  Reception of the application will be confirmed within 2 weeks. Acceptance at the KIT will be confirmed within 4 to 6 weeks after the application deadline.   Information for incoming students   Useful information for incoming students can be found in our student handbook:   Lectures/Courses/ Project    Information on courses, course descriptions, schedule etc. can also be found in the student handbook:   Please note that course registration for some seminars and lectures is required. However, it is only possible to do the registration once the student has been enrolled, i.e. by the beginning of October/the beginning of April. If further information is required, it is best to contact the lecturer directly and enquire about course details. Fees  Students from partner universities pay a social contribution of about 77.70 E2AC per semester. This includes reduced student prices at the university restaurant, transportation reductions and accident insurance:  www.swka.de/en/finanzen/semesterbeitraege &nb;sp;  Health insurance ;  Health insurance coverage is compulsory for the entire stay in Germany (with a coverage of at least 100,000.00 E2AC). Students can take out health insurance in their home country before arriving in Karlsruhe or take out German public health insurance upon arrival during the orientation week.    September 2016   3/3   Accommodation  </span Most students in Karlsruhe live in dormitories or share a flat. There is, however, an acute shortage of living space, especially at the start of the winter semester. KIT cannot guarantee the availability of accommodation but they will do our best to assist all exchange students settling down in Karlsruhe.  Students will be informed about housing possibilities within 8 weeks of the application deadline. The KIT reserves rooms for students from partner universities in their studentsE2 residences if possible. These furnished single rooms cost 200300E2AC and have a set lease period from September to February and/or March to August. No other moving in/out date is possible.  German language courses   Since the majority of courses offered at the KIT are held in German only, a good command of German is necessary for any student coming to Karlsruhe. Recommended is at least an A2level of the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).   KIT accepts most types of German certificates including certificates from partner universityE2s language centre as long as it clearly states the successful completion of the language level with regard to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. This means that a simple certificate of attendance for a language course without any mention of a successful examination is not sufficient (i.e. participating in an A2 language course does not mean that the level has been reached).  Should the German language proficiency not match the minimum requirements, we strongly advise all students to use the time left in the home country to obtain the necessary skills. KIT reserves the right to decline the studentsE2 application.  If students want to estimate their CEFRlevel of German, they might do so using following online test provided by the Goethe Institute.   KIT offers a presemester German language course for all exchange students about 3 weeks before the courses begin. This course is not a substitute for the certificate of the German language level required for the application.  Visa/residence permit   Exchange students from   nonEU member states or  nonEEA member states require student visas (not tourist visas) in order to study in G ermany. This visa can be obtained at your local German embassy.  To receive this visa, students need the E2CZulassungsbescheidE2D (Admission Letter) from the KIT. &nbsp; Please do note that the processing time for a student visa can take 8 weeks or longer depending on the local embassy. The KIT cannot affect this procedure. Please inform your students to apply for a student visa as soon as they receive the E2CAdmission LetterE2D.
