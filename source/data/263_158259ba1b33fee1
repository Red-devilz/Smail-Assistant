Hello everyone!

The IITM Quiz Club will be having a quiz club meet on the 3rd of November,
Thursday from 8.30 PM at HSB 334. We have what promises to be a thoroughly
exciting quiz hosted by our enthusiastic freshers Govind Sankar, Meenakshi
Vishwanathan, Shravya Chavali and Swati Nair. Be there for an exciting
couple of hours!

No prerequisite other than enthusiasm and interest needed. Teams will be
formed on the spot with a senior member in each team. Direct finals, so
everyone will get a chance to participate directly.

Feel free to contact the conveners for any details.

Cheers,
Quiz Club Conveners
