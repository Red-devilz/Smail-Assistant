His specialization is in phase transformations, especially martensitic and displacive transformations, in shape memory alloys. He has thirty years of research experience and he is internationally well known for his contribution to the basic understanding in this field. His major research interests include characterization of NiTi, Cubased, Febased and ferromagnetic shape memory materials by transmission electron microscopy, Xray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry. Dr. Madangopal Krishnan and his team have developed the industrial scale technology for processing of shape memory alloys and designing their engineering applications. He was also involved in developing NiTi heat shrinkable fasteners and superelastic springs for the prestigious Light Combat Aircraft programme. For his excellent contribution to this field, DRDO Award for Path Breaking Research/Outstanding Technology Development for 2011 was conferred on him.  All are welcome to attend the lectures.    Thanking you in advance.  With regards,           Dr. SUNDARARAMAN M  Visiting Professor   Office:HSB134  Dept.
