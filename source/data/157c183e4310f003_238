<font color=3D"#000066"><b>Abstract:</b></font><br><br>Ground Penetrating R=
adar (GPR) is a type of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) method for identif=
ication, detection, and location of subsurface features using EM techniques=
. It is used for both civilian and military applications like pavement insp=
ection, cracks, corrosion and/or leakages in buried pipes, and detection of=
 anti-personnel mines. Commercially available GPR systems employ pulse mode=
 of operation for detection and have limitations on the unambiguous range a=
nd signal to noise ratio (SNR). Unlike pulse radar, Stepped Frequency Conti=
nuous Wave (SFCW) radar operates in frequency domain and provides the flexi=
bility to adjust the operating frequency points and signal power to suit th=
e material and target under investigation. This work investigates the use o=
f SFCW radar for detection of metallic and non-metallic objects for mono-st=
atic and bi-static antenna configurations.\r\nAn ultra wide band (UWB) slot=
 spiral antenna w
 as
designed, optimized for efficient radiation (using reflection coefficients)=
 and realized for SFCW radar operation over 600 MHz to 4000 MHz. The spiral=
 antenna is circularly polarized with an overall dimension of 18 cm =C3=97 =
18 cm and has symmetric broadside radiation pattern. With the help of elect=
romagnetic absorbers, the back radiation was suppressed as high as 20 dB at=
 1 GHz. The Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) and the gain of the UWB antenna we=
re measured as 80 degree and 1 dB at 1 GHz respectively. \r\nThe antenna wa=
s used in Pulse-Echo (mono-static) and Pitch-Catch (bi-static) modes of ope=
ration for SFCW demonstration for -5 dBm input power. The unambiguous targe=
t detection range measured from the A scans was 18 cm in free space and 14 =
cm inside the inhomogeneous sandbox in mono-static configuration with anten=
na in the near field of the interrogating medium. The unambiguous target ra=
nge in bi-static mode was found to be 700 cm in free space and 500 cm throu=
gh the wall. The in
 fluence
of SFCW parameters such as frequency window, frequency step and intermediat=
e frequency band width (IFBW) on target detection was studied by varying tr=
ansmit-receive settings in a vector network analyzer. Experimental investig=
ations demonstrate that SNR and target detection could be enhanced in SFCW =
radar by optimizing the control parameters to suit the medium and target pr=
operty which is typically achieved with signal post processing in pulse rad=
ar technique.    \r\n\r\nKey words: slot spiral, ultra wide band antenna, r=
adar, SFWC.\r\n<br><br><br>
