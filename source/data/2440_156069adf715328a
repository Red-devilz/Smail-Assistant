All are invited to attend.        "The IGBT Miracle: From Conception to Global Impact"  Distinguished University Professor B. Jayant Baliga  North Carolina State University  Raleigh, NC 27613    Abstract:  The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) has had an enormous impact on creating a sustainable society by enhancing the comfort and convenience of billions of people while reducing energy consumption. It is widely used in the consumer, industrial, transportation, lighting, medical, and renewable energy generation sectors. The greatest environmental impact is due to its utilization in electronic ignition systems, adjustable speed motor drives, and compact fluorescent lamps. During the last 25 years, this has reduced worldwide gasoline consumption by 1.5 Trillion gallons and reduced electrical energy consumption by more than 73,000 TerraWattHours leading to consumers saving $ 24 Trillion. This talk will discuss the challenges that had to be overcome to commercialize the IGBT and review its wide range of applications today.
