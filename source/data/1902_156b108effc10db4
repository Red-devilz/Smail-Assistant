 Hello Gangsters
 As few days are remaining for our GBM, I would like the avid readers o
f
 books and magazines to fill the form
 <
7R07jGMt1xE/edit so
 that budget can be allocated accordingly. The books and magazines you
 mention in the form are not very sure to arrive , it will depend on bu
dget
 and availability as well but I'll try my best to inculcate demands of
 all.The form will get opened only from your smail account so if
 while opening it says you don't have access, change the mail id. Fil
l
 the form by Saturday 11am.

 I even have made a database of quizzes and links of some previous
 performances as promised and uploaded on drive
  , so
 that people can have a brief idea of the questions in LitSoc quizzes 
and
 we can improve upon our performances. If anyone else has a video or se
t of
 quizzes which you think are important from the LitSoc point of view, 
do
 mail me. The database will be updated on a regular basis.
 There is a litsoc manual in the database folder as well, which
 contains the basic rules of some of the events as per litsoc
 201516 and that too will be upgraded on a regular basis.

 For any other clarifications and queries do mail me.

 PS only genuine readers fill the form,don't spam
