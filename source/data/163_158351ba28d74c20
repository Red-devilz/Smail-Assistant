Re: Gangasters Fire and Ice event

Body:
Lol moral support it seems. Its fire and ice. You buy a 30k RC car and let 
some guy drive it (something that requires a 4 year oldE2s intellect
) and then call it the flagship event of techsoc. The only thing people par
ticipating in this event need is a life F0F (no offence). How does
 this event get approved every year?!
