Organizer=E2=80=99s Profile:

Sunitha Ramadurai is a certified NLP Master Practitioner and Coach. After
having worked in the of IT for about 10 years, she returned to India last
year, pulled by a very compelling desire to work and serve with people. She
loves engaging with people and helping them explore their inner game that
then manifests as behaviours (emotions, thoughts, actions etc.) and thereby
bring forward their best side.

Currently, she works with corporates and a few people, coaching them with
their personal goals and walking with them through their problems.
Alongside, she uses NLP in education

(Teaching English) in accelerating learning, helping them learn in a way
that they understand.
