Subject:
Re: Gangasters Levelling of Quadrangle or Outdoor Gymnasium

Body:
This thread was started to decide between the quadi levelling and outdoor
gymnasium and instead of sticking to the purpose of the mail, we have
started discussing a vending machineF0F.

PS : I have been told that Ganga will mostly be getting a new vending
machine from the Institute

 Instead of a cafeteria functioning alongside the already existing
 jamuna cafe, why can't we have a vending machine? That way, the jam hu

 doesn't  lose out on patronage, and we get better options for food. St

 Hey!

 The cafeteria will be something like the one in Jamuna. That is anywa
y
 going to come up.

 The choice is between Quadi Levelling and stuff like parallel bars an
d
 monkey bars.
 It is big problem for Schroeter Practice if the Quadi isn't a level
 surface and hence, the poll to decide which is these is more preferre
d.
 This will help the Warden know what the hostel wants.

 Thanks

 Hey!

 The quadi will relaid with new soil and it will be a level surface
.
 This has been on the cards for very long and now we have budget to 
get this
 done.

 The outdoor gymnasium will consist of things like parallel bars,
 monkey bars, etc. These will be placed near the Basketball court.

 Thank you!

 Hey!
 Could you please explain what exactly are the two proposals, so
 that we can make a more informed decision?

 Thanks,

 Hello All!

 We have a specified amount of Alumni Budget this time. The Warden
 wants to use it for the cafeteria and for an outdoor gymnasium. I
f you
 people prefer to have the quadi relaid instead of the outdoor gy
mnasium,
 please fill this form.

 We can, then, let the warden know that majority of the people wan
t
 the quadi to be relaid instead of the outdoor gymnasium, if that
's the
 case.

 I would be really glad if you could fill this

 form ASAP.

 Thank you.
