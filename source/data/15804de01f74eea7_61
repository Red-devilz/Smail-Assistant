Dear Junta,

(Note: to be read in film trailer style)

From the makers of Muggle Quidditch and Queen of Sheba, the Informals Club
presents our second LitSoc event of the year-* Human Foosball! *

Have you ever played Foosball while sipping a drink and wondered "This game
would be fun if we could actually play in it.." and then slowly realized
that it would be a horrible idea as it would cause injury, pain and untold
humiliation? Well, here's your chance to experience all that first hand!
And we know you have to turn up coz Litsoc points!

So mark your calendars Calendars on the *29th of October (Saturday) at 3 pm
opposite the swimming pool. Come in teams of 8. *Each team must fill in
this registration form before 28th October 2016, 11:59 PM-

Try wearing athletic shoes.
Or not. More fun for us anyway if you're not.
