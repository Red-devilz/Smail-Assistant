CS Club

Body:
Hi Vishwanath,

This is Satya Prateek (CS13B018). I am the Secretary of CS Club for the
year 201617.
I am writing this mail to elaborate on the function of CS Club and what I
plan to do as Secretary of the club.

There are 6 major events I am thinking of definitely conducting:
1. Freshie Nite
2. CS Cup
3. Farewell
4. Exebit
5. Ethnic Day
6. Department Trips

There are some other activities like Tshirts for every batch, Teacher's
day celebrations (if any) etc. which also come under the purview of the
club. I would also try to organize as many of such activities depending on
the feasibility.

Apart from this, I have the responsibility of cultivating enthusiasm for
extracurricular activities among the students of the department, inspiring
juniors and making sure that CS Club continues for the years to come.
