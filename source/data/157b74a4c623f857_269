Hi Rahul Ramesh,

The project sounds very good.  You could also work out a timeline for
different modules involved in the project; if time constraints kick-in, you
may still be able to finish up some of the modules.  The GUI parts are
usually time-consuming, so you could design a CLI interface / library first
and then proceed to the GUI.

Let me know if you need some guidance on the ML parts.  One of you could
register at the HPCE site for an account on the libra clusters;  that will
let you train the ML models on GPU clusters using torch or caffe or theano.
