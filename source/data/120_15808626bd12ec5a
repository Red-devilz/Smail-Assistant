 A Talk by

 Dr. Vasanthi Devi
 Former ViceChancellor, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University

 on

 "New Education Policy"
 The Future of Higher Education in India


 Friday, 28th Oct 2016, 5:30PM
 Venue:
 HSB 356


 The draft New Education Policy is of huge significance at a time when the
 fees for higher education in Central Universities are on the rise all over
 India and more private players are making their way in this field.
 The discussions on New Education Policy got streamlined with the TSR
 Subramaniam committee submitting its report earlier this year.
 While high level meetings are underway at policy circles about finalising
 the New Education Policy, we at ChintaBAR wish to asses the implications
 this can have on the collegiate and higher education in future India.

 About the Speaker:

 Dr. V Vasanthi Devi, a noted academic, educationist and one of Tamil
 Nadu's vocal critics of gender, caste issues and the illeffects of liquor.
 She was the former ViceChancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University
 and a former Chairperson of the Tamil Nadu State Commission for Women. She
 contested against the incumbent Chief Minister, Ms. Jayalalitha, as a
 candidate of People's Welfare Front in the last TN Assembly Elections. She
 is currently heading Institute of Human Rights, a Madurai based NGO. She is
 also involved with acclaimed bodies like AIDIndia and a trustee and
 governing body member of many academic institutions. Over the years, she
 has fought valiantly for education rights.

 ChintaBAR  is a collective of
 students who engage in discussions on socially, economically
  and politically relevant topics. We hope to open up a space
 for discussions and debates on conflicting ideas of the pres
 ent, with interesting and creative minds of the day. We aim at promoting activities which
 will complement the academic ethos of IIT Madras.
