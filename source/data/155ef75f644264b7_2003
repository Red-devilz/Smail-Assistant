Dear Gen sec,
Can you circulate this mail in campus...

Hi
I am Deepshikha Das from Chemical Engg department,

I lost my black and purple purse today (15 July 2016) evening.
I lost it either of these places..

1. Ramu Tea stall near library
2. Campus Bus
3. wash room near Placement office

I had very important cards(PAN, ATM cards) in that including IITM ID card
(943DD).

If anyone finds it kindly call me on *9840351375 (treat assured).*

Thank you in advance.
