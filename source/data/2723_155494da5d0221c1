ABSTRACT :

Spent nuclear liquid waste is often kept in partially filled storage tanks.
 When such storage tanks are subjected to wind and/or earthquake induced ex
citations, this could lead to detrimental safety issues. Therefore, storage
 tank designers should ensure safe design margins and develop methodologies
 to overcome a wide range of possible scenarios. In the present study, syst
ematic numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the sloshing dy
namics of liquid in a storage tank, subjected to seismic excitation. As a p
recursor, the influence of resonant harmonic excitation on the free surface
 displacement, pressure distribution, slosh forces etc. is investigated. To
 suppress the free surface fluctuations and the associated slosh force, two
 types of baffles viz., ring and vertical baffle are assessed.  Based on th
e response to an imposed harmonic excitation, the vertical baffle plate in 
the middle of the tank, was found to be effective and its dimensions are sy
stematically optimized. This baffle geometry was also tested for a well kno
wn seismic excitation (El Centro earth quake).

                                                                           
                                     // ALL ARE WELCOME //
Thanks

With warm welcome
