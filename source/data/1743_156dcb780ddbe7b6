How many GitHub stars?

Body:
E2ADEFB8F Nylas N1 has 20k stars! E2ADEFB8F            
  Nylas N1 ranked #73 across more than 3.5 million projects.

Hi there E2 I'm Michael, the cofounder and CEO of Nylas.

We released  Nylas N1 [] less than a year ago
 via a small post on Hacker News. Today we're delighted to announce that 
N1 has become one of the top open source projects on GitHub! And it's lar
gely thanks to you, our fantastic community.

How many stars is 20k?

On GitHub, Nylas N1 is more popular than projects like Ansible, ElasticSe
arch, HHVM, GoLang, RethinkDB, Kubernetes, Rust, and many more. We're hum
bled to be included in such a list!

As N1 grows, we're going to be adding more and more premium features to o
ur paid version of the app, specifically for people using email at work. 
But our roots are always with developers , and N1 will always remain open
 source.

Thanks again for your support and (as always) let me know if you have any
 feedback for our team.

Michael

Cofounder & CEO
