ABSTRACT :

The effect of an electric field along the longitudinal axis of a nanoscale =
liquid thread is studied to understand the mechanism of breakup. The Raylei=
gh instability (commonly known as Plateau-Rayleigh instability (RI)) of a n=
anosized liquid water thread is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) =
simulations. The breakup mechanism of the liquid nanothread is studied by a=
nalysing the temporal evolution of the thread radius. The influence of the =
temperature of the liquid nanothread and the electric field strength on the=
 stability and breakup is the major focus of the study. The results show th=
at the axial electric field has a stabilizing effect even at nanoscale. The=
 results from the simulations are in good agreement with the solutions obta=
ined using the asymptotic theory for the liquid thread. The critical electr=
ic field strength necessary to avoid the breakup of the liquid thread is ca=
lculated and other effects such as splaying/whipping instability are also d=
iscussed.
