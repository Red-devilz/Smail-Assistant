Hey Guys!

So we're all geared up for this year's edition of Quater Ticket and there's
drama in the air. For those of you who don't know what that's all about,
each year we have a presentation of short plays directed, acted in and
produced by Insti Junta- that is you guys. It's a lot of fun and a
brilliant learning opportunity.

This year we're having two plays for which we're looking for actors. All
parts are open for auditions. Do come and check out the scripts and auditon
for roles. The Auditions will take place today (27/10/16) at SAC at 9 PM.

Here's hoping to see a lot of you turn up.

Cheers,
Thespian Conveners.
