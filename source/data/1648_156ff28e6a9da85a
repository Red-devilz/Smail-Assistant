[Opportunity] Network with Japanese Students from Tokyo Tech University

Body:
Dear students of IITM,

Greetings from the I&AR Student Council. We would like to present to you
one more great opportunity for networking with Japanese students.

We are hosting some of the Japanese students from Tokyo Institute of
Technology, who are here on an educational tour of 10 days.

We are arranging for an interaction session between them and our institute
students. They will first talk about various international opportunities
in their university for Indian students, followed by an interaction
session.

The session is scheduled on 7th September, from 5 pm onwards at Conference
Hall 2, IC&SR building.

We will choose a maximum of 20 students to participate in this event.
Interested students are requested to kindly fill this form
.

Thanks and Regards,
Poojan Patel
