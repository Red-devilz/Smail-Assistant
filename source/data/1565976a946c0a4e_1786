Dear all,

Greetings from *Centre for Innovation*! Hope you all had a great vacation.

The club activities in *C**FI* have grown enormously over the past couple
of years, and have increased both in variety and dimension. In order to
ensure smooth functioning, every club/dept. has a set of coordinators who
form the organizing team along with the heads.

Applications for posts of *coordinators* for * all clubs* and *organizing
teams *are now open. Interested ones are requested to fill this form

 by *11:59PM, 10th Aug'16*.

PS: This will involve not just work, but a lot of learning. *Second years
(and above)* are strongly encouraged to apply!
