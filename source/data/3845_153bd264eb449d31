Hi Bipin, please forward this email to hostel sports secretaries to send to
hostel groups.


Hi everyone,

Bridge Dean's trophy is just around the corner and I request those of you
who want to participate in this competition to please fill out the google
form link given below.

This will be a pairs event and so each player must participate with his/her
partner. The partner may or may not be from the same hostel. If you do not
have a partner, you will be made partner with some random person.

There will be four winner pairs in total and not separate winners from each
direction. First rank gets 10 points, second gets 6, third 4 and fourth 2
for their respective hostels. If partners are from different hostels, they
will share the points. In case of a tie, the total points will be shared
among the winners.

 Those of you participating in Dean's trophy must fill the form, or else
you will not be allowed to participate.

 If you know how to play bridge but do not follow any bidding system
convention, you will not be allowed to participate. You must follow a
bidding system to participate.

 For those of you, who do not follow any system, three fundae sessions
will be arranged in which standard bidding system will be taught. If you
attend the sessions, only then you will be allowed to participate in the
competition.


Players who want to participate in Dean's trophy for bridge, please fill
this form:

The deadline to fill the form is 1st April 2016
