 Hey Guys!

 After a brilliant Loose Character session by Krupa Verghese, Thespian Club
 is proud to present the first session of its Act Out series.

 This will give all you theatre enthusiasts a wonderful opportunity to act
 and direct out bits from select scripts. Its a hands on session and it'll
 give a wonderful insight into the making of a play.

 Do show up this Thursday (25/08/2016) at the SAC entrance at 6:30 PM
 for a ton of fun acting and directing activities.

 Cheers,

 Thespian Conveners
