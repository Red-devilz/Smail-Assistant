Dear Ajaykrishnan (and others who have faced a similar issue),

Sorryfor the delayed reply. This error seems to originate from some
limitation of the interpreter. WE HAVE DECIDED TO REMOVE
BINARYSEARCH.MICROIR FROM THE SET OF PUBLIC TESTCASES. Please ignore this
testcase. Sorry for the inconvenience caused due to it.

Thanks.
Warmregards,
Aman.
