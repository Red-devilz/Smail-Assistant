[Seminars] Mathematis Colloquium on Monday 3pm to 4pm By Prof M S
	Raghunathan @ Madhava Hall

Body:
b"     Dear All,     This semester,our last seminarin thediscrete mathematics seminar series is clubbed with a special seminar of the department and will benext Monday3pm at Madhava Hall. The talkwill begiven by Padma Vibhushan Professor M S Raghunathan from NCM. He is so well known that I don't attempt to introduce him.    Speaker: Prof. M S Raghunathan, National Centrefor Mathematics, IIT Bombay.   Title: The Prime Number Theorem    Date, Time, Venue: 18/Apr/2016. Monday, 3:00pm to 4:00pm. Madhava Hall (HSB 357).      Abstract : The Prime Number Theorem is arguably the most celebrated theorem in Number Theorem. It was proved in 1896 by the French mathematician J Hadamard and independently by the Belgian C de la Vallee Poussin in 1896. Both of them showed that the Riemann Zeta function has no zeros on the line {z|Re(z)D1} and deduced from this the assymptotic behaviour of (x) (the number of primes less than or equal to x) viz. that (x)/(x/logx) tends to 1 as x tends to infinity. This last deduction was rather complicated. A much pleasanter proof was devised by D J Newman in 1980. In this talk we will present a proof of the nonvanishing of the Zeta function on Re(z)D1 followed by Newman's simple deduction of the Prime number Theorem from it.  All are welcome.       narayanan  PS: Tea/snacks will served at the end of the talk.       "
