LTAP - please fill up this survey at the earliest

Body:
Dear Rahul Ramesh

REMINDER...  Now, that you have time, please fill up this survey.

It will help introduce meaningful courses in LTAP.



Being an IITian, I see you as a potential leader in the society one day.  A
s you know, the spirit goes beyond academics.  Many successful leaders amon
g IITians have enriched themselves pursuing passions beyond academics or th
eir daily routine.  In every one of us, there is this aspect of enthusiasm 
to learn something or the other apart from the routine academics.  Many tim
es, the initial block has to do with not being able to reach the right plac
e at the right time to begin learning.  The initial enthusiasm loses steam 
before such a thing happens in our lives.

In order address precisely this,  we have embarked on a program called the 
Leisure Time Activities Program (LTAP) that facilitates learning at your d
oor step making learning new extra curricular activities/skills/tools smoot
h and regular.

This semester saw 1500+ students availing the facility.

While some of you must be availing this, many of you may have a set of such
 activities in your wish list. I request you to kindly share with us this l
ist as how we can help you learn such skills or tools that will enrich your
 lives.

To this effect, we request you to share your thoughts on this through the l
ink provided to enable us to plan the list of learning modules that we will
 have ready come the next academic year.



Wishing you good luck with your endsem exams.

Anbudan,

Siva
