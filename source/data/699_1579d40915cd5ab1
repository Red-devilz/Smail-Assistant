Subject:
Lab4 deadline

Body:
As per the following moodle post and post in the OS google group, the
deadline for lab4(Writing a Shell) was extended to 7th Friday, October
2016. However the moodle submission link has a deadline of 3rd
October(monday). Should we wait for the deadline to be updated, or should
we submit without considering the same?



Thanks.
Rahul Ramesh
