Guide			:	Dr. Mahesh V Panchagnula

ABSTRACT :	

	

The possibility of employing both RayleighTaylor (RT) and KelvinHelmholt
z (KH) mechanisms Threedimensional sessile drops are ubiquitous in nature
. We present the results of a new statistical approach to determining Conta
ct Angle Hysteresis by studying the nature of the triple line. The local co
ntact angle is calculated from the measured three phase contact line (tripl
e line) of the sessile drop. Drops with randomly shaped triple lines but of
 fixed volumes were deposited on a substrate and their triple line shapes w
ere extracted by imaging. Using a solution developed by Prabhala et al. (La
ngmuir, 2010), the complete three dimensional shape of the sessile drop was
 generated. This shape was compared with the experimentally imaged shape as
 validation. The local contact angle subtended by the sessile drop was then
 calculated as the gradient of the drop surface. A distribution of the loca
l contact angles for several such drops but of the same liquidsubstrate pa
irs is generated. This distribution is a result of several advancing and re
ceding processes along the triple line. The contact angle distribution is u
sed to yield an approximation of the Contact Angle Hysteresis associated wi
th the substrate. Static measurements, therefore, are shown to be sufficien
t to measure quasistatic contact angle hysteresis of a substrate.
