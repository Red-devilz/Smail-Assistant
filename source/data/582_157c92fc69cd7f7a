Re: Gangasters Important: Library - Action Plan, Rules and Donation

Body:
We didn't had library for the past couple of years. Moreover there are some
books in common room but those are not in good condition. This time we are
buying a separate cupboard (with lock) so that books can be preserved for a
longer duration.

 New books will be coming soon when I buy the next bunch of books (ie
 after Quiz 2) and since the library is being setup after long time we ne
ed
 more books and hence we'll prefer mostly second hand books!!
