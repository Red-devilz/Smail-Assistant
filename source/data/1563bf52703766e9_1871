Subject: ALTINA ESSAY CONTEST 2016

Dear Sir/Madam,

Altina Securities Pvt. Ltd as a part of its Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) has been playing a very active role in focusing on its twin objectives
of Promoting and nurturing entrepreneurship both at the start up and scale
up level as well as promoting financial literacy.

The company promoted by Mr. Clifton Desilva who has over 35 years of
experience in all facets of the capital market is leveraging his expertise
of several years to groom and mentor entrepreneurs both at the start up and
scale up level. Over the last several years Altina Securities is credited
with grooming entrepreneurs from scratch to multi billionaires. The primary
objective is to educate aspiring entrepreneurs about entrepreneurship and
motivate them to establish their own ventures. The mentoring sessions
organized are addressed by eminent entrepreneurs and industry leaders with a
view to encourage aspiring entrepreneurs to take up the path of
entrepreneurship. Apart from being instrumental in aiding companies to
create value Altina Securities is also handholding companies especially in
the small and medium sector to unlock value by advising them to list their
companies on the SME platform of the National Stock Exchange and the BSE.
According to an estimate India needs 1.5 million jobs per year to provide
gainful employment to India's young population. Large business houses in
India both in the private and public sector may find it difficult to
generate employment on such a large scale. Therefore there is a need to
actively focus on entrepreneurship which can help in creating jobs to absorb
India's young population

Another focus area is financial literacy wherein the company continues to
play an active role through initiatives like seminars, conferences and
workshops on financial literacy. Also financial literacy is spread through
publications of articles on investments in leading investment publications.
Till date over 1000 articles have been published as a part of the financial
literacy initiative.  As far as investment seminars are concerned the
company has organized and participated in over 1000 investment seminars. In
the year October 2013 Capital Finance International nominated the company
for the best investor education programme in India -2013 which included
voting from IMF and World Bank.

Post liberalization the Indian economy has undergone a sea change and is
integrated with the global economy. Competition has also intensified, with
transparency, corporate governance, and a more structured format being the
order of the day. In order to showcase the models on which professional
companies are operated Altina Securities has organized several industrial
tours to leading companies like Tata Motors Ltd. (Pune), Siemens India
Ltd.(Nasik)   Piaggio (India) Pvt Ltd.- Vespa( Baramati)  Flamingo Pharma
Ltd. ( Taloja) Chances Resorts and Casino,(Goa) Quodros Motors Pvt. Ltd.
(Goa) to name a few.

ALL THESE INITIATIVES ARE FREE OF COST TO THE PARTICIPANTS

In order to identify and mentor aspiring entrepreneurs every year Altina
Securities organizes an essay contest on topics relating to
entrepreneurships. This initiative was launched in the year 2010.
