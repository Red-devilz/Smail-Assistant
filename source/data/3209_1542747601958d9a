Pollution by numerous anthropogenic substances threatens water quality worl
dwide. Micropollutants in low levels are difficult to analyse due to need 
for sophisticated instrumentation. Environmental legislation clearly define
s the need for regular monitoring of pollutants down as low as to nanogram 
per liter levels. Biomonitoring done in parallel with chemical analyses of 
micropollutants, would validate the biomonitoring techniques. There are sev
eral advances in the field of biomonitoring ranging from laboratory experim
ents to Automated Biomonitoring in the field.

 European expert groups have developed automated biomonitoring systems for 
water quality. It includes an exposure chamber for housing an aquatic organ
ism having ventilator behaviour and body movement sensitive to water qualit
y. Electrodes sense electrical signals produced by the organism during its 
ventilatory behaviour and body movement, and a controller responsive to sig
nals from the electrodes determines a plurality of ventilatory parameters b
ased on the signals. The Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorAE (MFB) can mo
nitor the toxic risk of chemical mixtures on indicator organisms, which wil
l be recorded as stress behaviours like ventilation, avoidance, morbidity a
nd mortality. Automated biomonitors are widely used in European countries a
nd USA , whereas this technology is new for India.  Till now seven species 
from Indian water bodies are used as indicator organism in MFB and  applied
 in the sewage quality analysis, fish and prawn farms and rivers by SCMS Wa
ter Institute experts. So there is a necessity to share this knowledge & te
chnology to the society which will be a great use for propagation of automa
ted biosensing in India.

In this workshop it is proposed to have informative lectures on stateofth
e art in  biomonitoring and then train participants in use of automated mo
nitoring  in various fields like aquaculture, water works, water and wastew
ater treatment plants, waste disposals, drinking/bottled water industries ,
 solid sludge waste management and river protection agency.

Objective of Workshop:

1.      Introduction to concepts of biomonitoring and laboratory method of 
monitoring

2.      Capacity Building in automated biomonitors using Multispecies Fresh
water Biomonitoring.

3.      Ideal organism for use in agriculture and aquaculture (by communica
ting with experts from various fields).

Target Audience: Students/ResearchScholars/Faculty/ Scientists and stakehol
ders like agricultural farmers and aquaculture farmers who wish to test the
ir water in the field and pollution control personnel  are also welcome.

Tentative Dates of the Workshop : 2nd to 3rd May, 2016 Venue ICSR Hall I  (
 Workshop will continue  in the lab/field for  from 3rd May  as required fo
r the water  samples  )
