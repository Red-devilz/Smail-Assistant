 hello guys!!!

 As the hostel night is too close, we need to get the RG posters printed
 tomorrow.
 We need the edited version of the RG forms(writeupin doc format) from
 the pre final years and passouts by tonight 10 pm(06/04/2016).Otherwise
 the RGs (without writeup) will be put up only with photos.

 Please send the writeups to
 ee14b110@smail.iitm.ac.in <ee14b110@smail.iitm.ac.in    or
 ch14b085@smail..iitm.ac.in 


 Please note that  we were repeatedly intimating the passouts and prefinal
 years to send their edited version of the RG forms as we didn't want the
 RGs to be printed in the last moment.

 For any discrepanies,call 9940509873 or 9176492137
