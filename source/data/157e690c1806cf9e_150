Ever wanted to make a quad rotor after watching 3 idiot but never got the  
chance? So here is the chance when you can actually make a quad copter of  
your own which will be funded by the hostel and workshop will be conducted  
by the Aero Club. Only 1 team is allowed per hostel so fill out the form if  
you are interested and team will be formed based on the responses. The  
workshop is scheduled on 31 Oct and 1st Nov. The same quad rotor will be  
used for participating in Shaastra and the tech soc event in even sem.
