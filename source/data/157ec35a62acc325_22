Hi Mohnish,

 This is Ramnandan, 2016 CS Dual Degree Grad. We're looking to expand our
dev team for our startup Fastnext. Uttej apparently spoke to you about this
and sending out a short write-up on the department groups. Can we get on a
call anytime to discuss this?

Here's the short write-up for your understanding anyways:



*What is Fastnext?*

 Fastnext is a data-driven recruitment platform backed by a powerful
Machine Learning-based matching engine. The recommendation technology
analyses millions of developer Internet profiles to find the perfect fit
for a company's requirements. We use data science and predictive analytics
to provide hyper-personalized recruitment.

 We are a startup, which has spun out of IIT-Madras. We=E2=80=99re part of =
the
NASSCOM Startup Warehouse Program (with office space in Tidel Park). We've
gone into sales and are currently working with 22 companies. We had worked
on an ed-tech product (Quabl) 2 years back before pivoting to our current
pursuit.

*What are we looking for?*

 As mentioned above, our web crawlers aggregate data from multiple data
bins (LinkedIn, Github, StackOverflow,  HackerRank, SPOJ, etc) and ensure
maximum data about each candidate for a complete overview to be utilised by
the ML-based matching engine.

 We are also currently working on a cutting-edge chatbot interface for the
AI engine that you can talk to =E2=80=93 either as a recruiter or a candida=
te
(Pretty cool, I know :))

 We are looking to expand our development team with enthusiastic junta
looking to be part of a fast-paced high-growth startup. We are looking for
junta with knowledge of (or willing to quickly pick up):

=C2=B7      Django

=C2=B7      Natural Language Processing (for the chatbot under development)

=C2=B7      Machine Learning

 If you think you=E2=80=99d be a good fit in our team, do send us your resu=
me at
nandparikrish@gmail.com or call me at +919940166031 (I=E2=80=99m Ramnandan
Krishnamurthy, a recent CS Dual Degree graduate and Co-founder of Fastnext
