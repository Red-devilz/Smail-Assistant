Hey guys!

We, the Thespians, hereby announce the first edition of Dial a director. As
the title probably gives away, its a chance to try out your directorial
ambitions. Captain the ship you've always wanted to. Please join us to
celebrate theatre, laughter and much more. Come and watch the fabulous
performances put up by your hostel teams at CLT at 5PM on 29/10/2016
(Saturday).

If you are interested in participating, contact your Litsec ASAP.

Cheers
Thespian Club.
