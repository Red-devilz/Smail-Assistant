Phone lost in CRC

Body:
I have lost my phone in CRC between 10:00 am to 12:00 pm today
(23.09.2016), in either CRC 205 or CRC 305. The phone details are 

Black OnePlus One (Sandstone finish) with a tempered glass (with a few
cracks and dents on it).

If anyone has found it or has any information about who might have it
please contact
