Hi Guys,

I hope everyone would have started studying by now :D
This year we are going to do something different as compared to past years
and that will be to *Introduce projects at hostel level which can be
practically implemented in the hostel* for the benefit of all the students.
We have the budget to fund 3 small scale projects and I already have ideas
for 2 of them.

Now my motive of sending this mail during quiz week is that during this
time only we think about all the problems of the universe and discuss about
everything except studies :P

So if you come up with any of the problem which can be solved by technology
and that can be implemented in our hostel then* you can post in this thread
during the next 10 days*. The work on the project will start from *20th
Sept.*

All the Best for Quizzes...!!!
