Those who wish to dine in groups will have to do the following:  (a) There will be an option to create a unique group name. Please make sure the members of your group know the group name (for example, if you type the group name as 'abc1' then make sure your group members know that this is the group name). Whoever creates the group name is the leader of the group and the preferences given by that leader only will be used for allocation. If you are already a leader of a group, you cannot join another group or you cannot come out of the group.</p (b) There will be an option for joining a group as member. You will be asked to type the group name that you wish to join. One student can join in only one group. The members can opt out of the group if they wish; they can also join another group or register as individual at any time before the dead line for registration.  (c) A group can have a maximum of 8 members only. When the number in the group exceeds 8, there will be a flag shown alerting that you cannot join that group.  (d) Each group will get only one chance in the random pick.   Any additional decisions on mess allocation will rest with the Hostel Mess Allocation committee.
