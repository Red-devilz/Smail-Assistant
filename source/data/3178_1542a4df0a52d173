 @Gensec I think that's a bad idea that you should stay far far away from
.
 Especially with the levels of inaction on the parts of secretaries this
 year, having a moderated group will suppress people's ability to express
 opinions and frequent concerns on usual issues. It's a bad policy to hav
e
 potential moderators who would be in no hurry to approve inconvenient ma
ils.

 If we as true gangasters are truly as great as we claim to be, i think w
e
 should take passing criticism of our music less seriously. :P Since anyw
ay
 the matter is not totally in our hands, might as well live happy lives a
nd
 do what we can while we can. I love our hostel to a reasonable extent an
d
 like to see it win, but i'm not sure how reasonable it is to expect the
 same sentiment out of everybody. It is going to be just a hostel for som
e.
 Getting angry with people who aren't as attached to Ganga as you will on
ly
 pain you more, and as some of our fellow gangasters will confirm, there 
are
 far more effective ways of paining oneself on a regular basis. :P

 Chill out, guys!!

 Cheers,
 Samir.

 No one is throwing anyone out of this group, I assure you that. I m
 Ganga Google group manager.

 This spamming has to stop now. No more mails on this thread or else i
 have to change the group settings and then all the mails on this group 
will
 be moderated by the manager. I Dont wanna do that but if this goes on I
 will.

 This thing is getting out of hand. This group is open to the group
 members for a reason. Please do not mail anything irrelevant/stupid to 
this
 group anymore.

 Hi!

 Just to strike a balanced note here. Let's all be nice and courteous an
d
 not indulge in personal attacks. It's wrong for anyone to be thrown out
 of
 this group (though I really understand the emotions behind the demand).

 Let him tell that for him, Ganga is just a hostel. We will show him tha

 for us, all students living in Ganga are Gangasters and are one of our 
own,
 and that despite what arguments we have amongst each other, we will car

 Hi,

 Sorry guys, I don't intend to spam this thread but this is too
 much.

 As the hostel who has consistently placed in the top positions in
 all music competitions and with highly qualified members (Who don
't need
 certificates to prove their credibility, since they're actually g
etting
 paid to pursue music), we sincerely apologize for helping Ganga w
in all
 sorts of competitions with our "poor skills in music". As a soca
lled
 musician yourself, I didn't expect that one could go so low and p
ersonal in
 some issue like this, which can be settled peacefully (Which we h
ave tried,
 but to no avail, as you can see). We are being diplomatic and pol
ite
 (Trying to respect someone older and more experienced than us) an
d you
 throw replies at us such as "Just to prove that my claim is not
 as hollow as your head I have sent one of my certificates to your
 personal
 mail. Now, you may suck that rat's posterior or frontal part as y
ou
 prefer." Being someone senior to us, we expected someone more mat
ure. But
 no, that isn't the case.

 Anyway, we'll stop playing our "terrible music" by Sunday, so you
 can peacefully study then or do whatever it is that you do. Hence
, I
 request you to please stop spamming this group with more thinly v
eiled
 personal insults at someone you don't know and can't appreciate. 
Thank you
 so much for adjusting with us, it's really generous of you!

 I hope that this issue is settled now. You could talk to us
 personally (We'll be in the music room!) if we're again irritatin
g you, and
 we'll try our best not to. Thanks!

 +1 to Ravi. Even I never heard of such issues being raised.

 I have no connection into music but their's was pretty decent
 to hear. Their volume level was pretty reasonable and you can
't ask them to
 play music like murmuring. If someone is very good at music, 
why can't you
 just participate in the hostel team? Or atleast guide them to
 play
 properly? Openly criticizing says that you have no feel for h
ostel at all,
 try encouraging man. You need not cheer all the way during th
eir
 participation, atleast adjust for very few days.

 @Rakesh Vakr, All the hostels participate and hence practice.
 Hence changing hostel might not help him. Probably he should 
stay outside
 campus himself without any authorities involving.

 If Ganga is nothing to you more than a hostel, your
 certificates are nothing more than a paper.

 @arjunar Thanks for your opinion, but I assure you we do not
 give a rat's posterior end about it. We're pretty convinced 
the issue isn't
 with our music, par Kanpur mein kuch problem hai. I call blu
ff on your
 claims of you being a musician yourself, because a true musi
cian wouldn't
 berate another's efforts. I maintain that you're either tone
deaf or that
 you are hallucinating the "music that sucks".
 The world does not revolve around you, and certainly, neithe
r
 does Ganga hostel.

 This direct offensive assault on the quality of the Ganga
 music team is really depressing, as we want the hostel membe
rs to be one
 big united family (not that we are taking it one bit serious
ly). You really
 do not seem to fit in here. Instead of all of us going elsew
here, why don't
 you request for a change of hostel? That's a more feasible s
olution, and a
 winwin situation for us.

 Thanks, don't come again
