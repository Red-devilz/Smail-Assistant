Dear Professor,

I hope this message finds you well!

I, Uttaran Dutta, am an Assistant Professor in the Hugh Downs School of
Human Communication, Arizona State University, USA. This year, I would like
to recruit a couple of students as research interns who can meaningfully
contribute to my research program.



Call for Application (CFA)

This CFA is regarding an internship opportunity (off-site and part-time)
for this summer (June-Mid August 2015).

Please let me share some of the key points about the same:

Domain of research: Software Development, Web-App/Android-App development,
GUI Design, Information and Communication Technology for Development
(ICT4D).

Requirement: Knowledge and experience of Back-end Development [C#, Java,
Python, PHP, Android] and/or Front-end development [ASP, HTML5] would be
helpful. Knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator/CorelDraw is a plus.

Other requirement: Ability to read and talk in Hindi AND/OR Bengali
language is a basic minimum requirement, as the interns have to design for
illiterate/semi-literate villages. Research Interns must have their own
computers and accessories.

Requirement: Research intern(s) will work from their home/ institution.
They will attend weekly/ biweekly (mandatory) meeting with me (in-person)
in/ around Kolkata, India.

Duration: 8 weeks. Tentative timeline- Last week of May to First week of
August, 2016.

Additional information: A certificate/letter will be given to all the
interns upon successful completion of their internship. Future research
collaboration/ co-authorship is a possibility. In addition, a consolidated
honorarium will be offered to all the selected Research Interns.

Application process: Please send (i) a detailed CV (with an URL of online
portfolio/ website), and (ii) a statement (less than 250 words) explaining why
you are interested to participate in this research program to
d.uttaran@gmail.com preferably on or before April 28th, 2016.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any question about the
internship.

Many thanks and best regards,

Uttaran Dutta, Ph.D
