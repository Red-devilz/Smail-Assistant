<div class=3D"gmail_quote"><span>Dear campus resident,<br>
<br>
The following is a plea to consider a firework-free and pollution-free Deep=
avali/Diwali inside our campus.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span>The quantity and impact of firecrackers that were availa=
ble a generation ago was far lesser than what is available now. So, things =
that were acceptable 20 years ago may no longer be acceptable today due to =
the quantum of pollution it can
 create.</span>&nbsp;Every year there are a large number of injuries and fe=
w fatalities due to firecrackers. This is a well known hazard and many coun=
tries do not permit private citizens to light fire crackers in un-supervise=
d conditions.
<br>
<br>
On the IITM campus, use of firecrackers has adverse outcomes. The campus is=
 the shared home of many species of animals, many species of birds includin=
g winter migrants who fly in from many hundreds of miles. On account of the=
 noise and pollution of the firecrackers,
 trauma in animals can lead to severe consequences. A little bit of sensiti=
vity on our part can help the animals and other species tremendously. We ur=
ge you to pay a little attention to their distress and convince yourself on=
 the merits of our line of thought.<br>
<br>
</span><span><font size=3D"2"><span style=3D"font-size:10pt;">As per the MO=
EF, Govt of India, guidelines,&nbsp; an educational institution, needs to b=
e considered&nbsp; as Silence Zone.
</span></font></span><font size=3D"2"><span style=3D"font-size:10pt;"><br>
(http://envfor.nic.in/downloads/public-information/noise-pollution-rules-en=
.pdf)<br>
The following in a supreme court rule regarding firecrackers and pollution =
(page 22 of the reference above)&nbsp;is applicable&nbsp;to&nbsp;silence&nb=
sp;zones :<br>
&quot;(3) Firecrackers shall not be used at any time in silence zones, as d=
efined in S.O. 1046(E) issued on 22.11.2000 by the Ministry of Environment =
and Forests. In the said Notification Silence Zone has been defined as:<br>
&quot; Silence Zone is an area comprising not less than 100 meters around h=
ospitals, educational institutions, courts, religious places or any other a=
rea which is declared as such by the competent authority.&quot;</span></fon=
t><br>
<br>
While there are many mitigating circumstances (we understand !!), we think =
it may be worthwhile to at-least ponder these questions before reaching for=
 the wallet to pay for firecrackers.<br>
<br>
Prakriti strongly urges you to consider an eco-friendly Deepavali/Diwali ce=
lebration, giving special consideration for our campus flora and fauna.<br>
<br>
Wish you all a joyous Diwali/Deepavali.<br>
