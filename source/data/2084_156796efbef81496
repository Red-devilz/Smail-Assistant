 Greetings wonderful residents of insti, we hope you all had a refreshing
 weekend. If you didnE2t, maybe you need to find new friends or sto
p watching
 E2CRoadiesE2D or maybe do both.

 We, the folks at Comedy Club, are extremely delighted and honoured to kic
k
 off the LitSoc campaign with the first event of the calendar year, which
 also happens to be the first event in the history of our club. On this
 momentous occasion, we present you a workshop onStandup Comedy by B
alakumaran
 Murugesan. Basically, he is funnier than you, your family, and your
 friends combined, and he is here to let you in on a few of his secrets (O
n
 how to be funny of course. No one openly pronounces their love for Kanye 
or
 KRK)





 Balakumaran Murgesan is a standup comedian, and has performed in over a
 hundred and fifty comedy shows. He is associated with the popular comedy
 super group E2CEvamE2D and is often referred to as one of the
 best standup
 comics in South India by peers and critics alike. He is also Creative
 Director at digital media entertainment giants PutChutney productions and
 an award winning playright. In short, he is Da Vinci.



 We know none of you had ever dreamed of becoming standup comedians when
 you were kids, however the workshop will be great fun nonetheless. There
 will be interesting speaking games, insights on how to deliver great joke
s
  and develop your own quirky sense of humour (Chandler Bing level), ti
ps
 on gauging audience feedback, how to keep a confident posture, analysing
 your own content and lots more.



 So to all those who want to enjoy a great laugh and try their hand at
 standup or want to learn to be funny, please do show up at CRC 103 on
 Thursday 5:45pm. It is the first of our workshops, and a great step towar
ds
 becoming a funnier person. Standup comedian aspirations or not, you will
 leave the event feeling wittier and wiser, if not, we can always sue Bala
.
