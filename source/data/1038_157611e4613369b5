Subject:
Gangasters CYCLE PARKING

Body:
Friends,
Please do not park in the NOPARKING zones... because it makes it difficult
for those who have parked their cycles inside to take them outside.
Or from today onwards the security guards will lock those cycles up :(

Expecially on the right side parking (when leaving the hostel)

Hope you guys take notice :)

Pradyumna(HL) here
