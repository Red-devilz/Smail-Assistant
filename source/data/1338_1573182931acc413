 Research Scholars' Day (RSD) is an annual event organised by Research
 Scholars of IIT Madras. RSD was kick started in 2012 under the
 leadership of Ms. Ishitha kumar (RAS,2012). The aim of RSD is to bring
 research scholars under one roof and provide platforms to learn  from
 experts, decimate their research outcomes and share their knowledge with
 peers across the institute and industry. RSD spans over a week with
 events ranging from lecture series by eminent personalities, workshops
 on various software and hardware platforms and a research expo
 where students showcase their research work through posters and presen
tations
 to the attendees. 


 Vision of Research Scholars day




    
  Research Scholars day is an event aimed at providing a nurturing
    platform for research scholars to  develop and enhance technical skil
ls
    with  the help of technical workshops, seminal lectures and co
     curricular events in the different fields of expertise. 
    
  It aims at dissemination of knowledge by the experts from industries
    and leading researchers. 
    
  It aims to showcase the talents of research scholars in different
    extracurricular activities. 
      It aims to become the largest event of the research scholars in
    campus and decimate knowledge to the research community across the na
tion.


 We are planning to organise following events in RSD 2017.



 1. Research Expo

 RSD 2017 provides a platform for aspiring research scholars to showcase
 their talent through working models, posters and presentations. We host 
a
 special event called "Explain Your Research in Two Minutes" in which
 interested scholars can explain their research in two minutes to colleag
ues
 and a panel of judges. Research Scholars with interesting outcomes will 
be
 recognised with appropriate awards. 


 2. Industry  R&D Expo

 RSD provides a platform for startups and established companies to
 showcase their latest products and research outcomes. We also provide an
 opprtrunity to these companies to reach out to our research scholars. Th
is
 event aims to make research scholars familiar with the kind of research
 done in companies and relate to it.




 3. Research Lecture Series by eminent personalities

 It is always encouraging and motivating to hear from eminent
 personalities. This RSD, we bring some of the wellknown personalities t

 experts and research scholars.

 continuing efficient research and develop their personality. In fact it
E2s a
 process to discover themselves.
