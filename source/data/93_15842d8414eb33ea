Subject:
Re: query regarding registration.

Body:
The main query we had was regarding whether we have a free elective or 
a selfstudy elective. The information in the link below is a bit 
ambiguous  and we wanted to clarify:

 %20DegreeL2014.pdf.

We are unable to recall the other doubt we had but I guess it wasn't as 
important.

I have one more query regarding the course registration. Are we 
required to get a COT for the freeelective course? I plan on taking a 
course in the Elec department and their department does not require a 
COT for the course I plan on taking(EE5154).

Thank you for your time.
