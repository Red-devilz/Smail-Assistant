Assignment1 Que. 3(d) recorrection
by CS13D023 MANAS THAKUR  Thursday, 22 September 2016, 4:37 PM

Dear all,
We have slightly modified the marking scheme for Que. 3(d) of the written
assignment. Those of you who did not get marks because of writing a
recursive grammar can meet me in PACE lab tomorrow in the second half
(along with your answer sheets).

Regards,
Manas
