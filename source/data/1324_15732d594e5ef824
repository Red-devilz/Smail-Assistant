 Hihihi,

 Freshie Creative Writing will happen this FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 16 so do turn
 up at CRC 201 at 6 pm then if youre into writing or you just want to sit in
 ac for a while and look at people do their thang. Bring some friends, knock
 on doors or go full and spam WhatsApp class groups with this delightful
 poster maybe. Thanks to the talented Alfy for the poster!

 September 16, yeah that's right, day after tomorrow + CRC 201

 A few prompts (words, sentences, phrases) will be provided on the spot and
 you're supposed to turn in a fiction piece of prose or poetry. Turn up if
 that one whole line made no sense at all as well :D Writing is a chill
 activity that can be attempted without shyness / prior experience. So, come
 off.

 Hoping to see some furious pen paper action,

 Aparna and Gerleo,

 Writing Club Convenors 201617.
