Hello  Junta,
Umpty number of times,there have been instances when we wish to have Moti  
Choor ke  Laddu or Suji ka Halwa or simply Barfi (or any sweet for that  
matter):Be it after having dinner in Himalayas or for celebrating a  
festival like Diwali or simply because the occasion can&#39;t be celebrated  
without them.

If you have such an unmet need within Insti,  kindly take out  1 minute of  
your precious time to fill up this survey to highlight your interest and  
preferences for the sweets you would like to have within Insti!
