ChintaBAR  is a collective of
students who engage in discussions on socially, economically
 and politically relevant topics. We hope to open up a space for
discussions and debates on conflicting ideas of the pre
sent, with interesting and creative minds of the day. We aim
 at promoting activities which will complement the academic
ethos of IIT Madras
