<div>&#8203;<br>
Gentle reminder on the&nbsp;first talkathon by EEA.<strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;Engineering Problem Solving<br>
<br>
<div><strong>Speaker:</strong>&nbsp;Prof. S. Karmalkar, Department of Elect=
rical Engineering<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><strong>Time and Date</strong>:&nbsp;3pm,&nbsp;24th September, 2016 (S=
aturday)<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><strong>Venue</strong>: Central Lecture Theatre (CLT)<br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Students might wonder why their core curric=
ulum contains subjects from diverse disciplines, e.g. why should an electri=
cal engineer undergo courses in chemistry, material science, economics etc.=
 This talk will illustrate with a simple
 example how the solution of a practical engineering problem requires appli=
cation of interdisciplinary knowledge and multiple skills. It will provide =
insight into real life problem solving, and help students recognize the nee=
d for subjects from several disciplines
 in the core engineering curriculum.&nbsp;<br>
